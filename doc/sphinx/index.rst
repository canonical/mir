Mir
===

Mir is an advanced display server designed to operate across a variety of Linux-based
devices, including traditional desktops, IoT and embedded systems.

As a library, Mir helps to build Wayland compositors that are commonly used in Linux
desktop environments.

Mir can be considered a modern alternative to the X window server system, providing
a well-defined, efficient, flexible and secure platform for graphical environments
that makes it an ideal choice for both device manufacturers and desktop users.
