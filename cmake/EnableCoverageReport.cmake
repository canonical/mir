# - Creates a special coverage build type and target on GCC.
#
# Defines a function ENABLE_COVERAGE_REPORT which generates the coverage target
# for selected targets. Optional arguments to this function are used to filter
# unwanted results using globbing expressions. Moreover targets with tests for
# the source code can be specified to trigger regenerating the report if the
# test has changed
#
# ENABLE_COVERAGE_REPORT(TARGETS target... [FILTER filter...] [TESTS test targets...])
#
# To generate a coverage report first build the project with
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage, then call make test and afterwards make coverage.
#
# The coverage report is based on gcov. Depending on the availability of lcov
# a HTML report will be generated and/or an XML report of gcovr is found.
# The generated coverage target executes all found solutions. Special targets
# exist to create e.g. only the xml report: coverage-xml.
