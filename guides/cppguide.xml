  <STYLEPOINT title="Displaying Hidden Details in this Guide">
     <SUMMARY>
       This style guide contains many details that are initially hidden from
       view.  They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your
       left.  Click it now.  You should see "Hooray" appear below.
     </SUMMARY>

        Hooray!  Now you know you can expand points to get more
        details.  Alternatively, there's an "expand all" at the
        top of this document.

<CATEGORY title="Background">
  <p>
    As every C++ programmer knows, the language has many powerful features,
    but this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make code more
    bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in
    detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code. These rules exist to keep
    the code base manageable while still allowing coders to use C++ language
    features productively.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Style</em>, also known as readability, is what we call the conventions
    that govern our C++ code. The term Style is a bit of a misnomer, since
    these conventions cover far more than just source file formatting.
  </p>
  <p>
    One way in which we keep the code base manageable is by enforcing
    <em>consistency</em>.  It is very important that any programmer be able to
    look at another's code and quickly understand it.  Maintaining a uniform
    style and following conventions means that we can more easily use
    "pattern-matching" to infer what various symbols are and what invariants
    are true about them. Creating common, required idioms and patterns makes
    code much easier to understand.  In some cases there might be good
    arguments for changing certain style rules, but we nonetheless keep things
    as they are in order to preserve consistency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another issue this guide addresses is that of C++ feature bloat.  C++ is a
    huge language with many advanced features. In some cases we constrain, or
    even ban, use of certain features. We do this to keep code simple and to
    avoid the various common errors and problems that these features can
    cause.  This guide lists these features and explains why their use is
    restricted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that the reader is
    familiar with the language.

</OVERVIEW>

<CATEGORY title="Header Files">
  <p>
    In general, every <code>.cpp</code> file should have an associated
    <code>.h</code> file. There are some common exceptions, such as
    unit tests and small <code>.cpp</code> files containing just a
    <code>main()</code> function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the
    readability, size and performance of your code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of
    using header files.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="The #define Guard">
    <SUMMARY>
      All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to
      prevent multiple inclusion.  The format of the symbol name
      should be
      <code><i>&lt;PROJECT&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;PATH&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>_H_</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>

      <p>
        To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path
        in a project's source tree.  For example, the file
        <code>foo/src/bar/baz.h</code> in project <code>foo</code> should
        have the following guard:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
         #ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
         #define FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_

         ...

         #endif  // FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
      </CODE_SNIPPET>

    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Header File Dependencies">
    <SUMMARY>
        Don't use an <code>#include</code> when a forward declaration
        would suffice.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        When you include a header file you introduce a dependency that
        will cause your code to be recompiled whenever the header file
        changes. If your header file includes other header files, any
        change to those files will cause any code that includes your
        header to be recompiled.  Therefore, we prefer to minimize
        includes, particularly includes of header files in other
        header files.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can significantly reduce the number of header files you
        need to include in your own header files by using forward
        declarations.  For example, if your header file uses the
        <code>File</code> class in ways that do not require access to
        the declaration of the <code>File</code> class, your header
        file can just forward declare <code>class File;</code> instead
        of having to <code>#include "file/base/file.h"</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can we use a class <code>Foo</code> in a header file
        without access to its definition?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> We can declare data members of type <code>Foo*</code> or
             <code>Foo&amp;</code>.
             </li>
        <li> We can declare (but not define) functions with arguments,
             and/or return values, of type <code>Foo</code>.  (One
             exception is if an argument <code>Foo</code>
             or <code>Foo const&amp;</code> has a
             non-<code>explicit</code>, one-argument constructor,

             in which case we need the full definition to support
             automatic type conversion.)
             </li>
        <li> We can declare static data members of type
             <code>Foo</code>.  This is because static data members
             are defined outside the class definition.
             </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the other hand, you must include the header file for
        <code>Foo</code> if your class subclasses <code>Foo</code> or
        has a data member of type <code>Foo</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes it makes sense to have pointer (or better,
        <code>unique_ptr</code>)
        members instead of object members. However, this complicates code
        readability and imposes a performance penalty, so avoid doing
        this transformation if the only purpose is to minimize includes
        in header files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, <code>.cpp</code> files typically do require the
        definitions of the classes they use, and usually have to
        include several header files.
      </p>

      <SUBSECTION title="Note:">
        If you use a symbol <code>Foo</code> in your source file, you
        should bring in a definition for <code>Foo</code> yourself,
        either via an #include or via a forward declaration.  Do not
        depend on the symbol being brought in transitively via headers
        not directly included.  One exception is if <code>Foo</code>
        is used in <code>myfile.cpp</code>, it's ok to #include (or
        forward-declare) <code>Foo</code> in <code>myfile.h</code>,
        instead of <code>myfile.cpp</code>.
      </SUBSECTION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Inline Functions">
    <SUMMARY>
      Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 10 lines
      or less.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to
        expand them inline rather than calling them through the usual
        function call mechanism.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code,
        as long as the inlined function is small. Feel free to inline
        accessors and mutators, and other short, performance-critical
        functions.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower.
        Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code
        size to increase or decrease.  Inlining a very small accessor
        function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very
        large function can dramatically increase code size.  On modern
        processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use
        of the instruction cache.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is
          more than 10 lines long. Beware of destructors, which are
          often longer than they appear because of implicit member-
          and base-destructor calls!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost
          effective to inline functions with loops or switch
          statements (unless, in the common case, the loop or switch
          statement is never executed).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to know that functions are not always
          inlined even if they are declared as such; for example,
          virtual and recursive functions are not normally inlined.
          Usually recursive functions should not be inline.  The main
          reason for making a virtual function inline is to place its
          definition in the class, either for convenience or to
          document its behavior, e.g., for accessors and mutators.
        </p>
      </DECISION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="The -inl.h Files">
    <SUMMARY>
      You may use file names with a <code>-inl.h</code> suffix to define
      complex inline functions when needed.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        The definition of an inline function needs to be in a header
        file, so that the compiler has the definition available for
        inlining at the call sites.  However, implementation code
        properly belongs in <code>.cpp</code> files, and we do not like
        to have much actual code in <code>.h</code> files unless there
        is a readability or performance advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an inline function definition is short, with very little,
        if any, logic in it, you should put the code in your
        <code>.h</code> file.  For example, accessors and mutators
        should certainly be inside a class definition.  More complex
        inline functions may also be put in a <code>.h</code> file for
        the convenience of the implementer and callers, though if this
        makes the <code>.h</code> file too unwieldy you can instead
        put that code in a separate <code>-inl.h</code> file.
        This separates the implementation from the class definition,
        while still allowing the implementation to be included where
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another use of <code>-inl.h</code> files is for definitions of
        function templates.  This can be used to keep your template
        definitions easy to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not forget that a <code>-inl.h</code> file requires a
        <a href="#The__define_Guard"><code>#define</code> guard</a> just
        like any other header file.
      </p>

    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Function Parameter Ordering">
    <SUMMARY>
      When defining a function, parameter order is: outputs,
      then inputs.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Parameters to C/C++ functions are either input to the
        function, output from the function, or both. Input parameters
        are usually values or <code>const</code> references, while output
        and input/output parameters will be non-<code>const</code>
        references or pointers to non-<code>const</code>. When ordering function 
        parameters, put all output parameters before any input-only parameters.
        In particular, do not add new parameters to the end of the function just
        because they are new; place new output parameters before the input-only
        parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a hard-and-fast rule.  Parameters that are both
        input and output (often classes/structs) muddy the waters,
        and, as always, consistency with related functions may require
        you to bend the rule.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Names and Order of Includes">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use standard order for readability and to avoid hidden
      dependencies: your
      project's public
      <code>.h</code>, your
      project's private 
      <code>.h</code>, other libraries' <code>.h</code>, .C library, C++ library,      
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>

        All of a project's header files should be
        listed as descendants of the project's source directory
        without use of UNIX directory shortcuts <code>.</code> (the current
        directory) or <code>..</code> (the parent directory).  For
        example,

        <code>my-awesome-project/src/base/logging.h</code>
        should be included as
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        #include "base/logging.h"
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        In <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cpp</code> or <code><var>dir/foo_test</var>.cpp</code>,
	whose main purpose is to implement or test the stuff in
        <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>, order your includes as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> (preferred location
          &#8212; see details below).</li>
	  <li>
	    Your project's public 
	  <code>.h</code> files.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Your project's private  
	  <code>.h</code> files.
	  </li>
	  <li> Other libraries' <code>.h</code> files.</li>
	  <li> C system files.</li>
	  <li> C++ system files.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The preferred ordering reduces hidden dependencies.  We want
        every header file to be compilable on its own.  The easiest
        way to achieve this is to make sure that every one of them is
        the first <code>.h</code> file <code>#include</code>d in some
        <code>.cpp</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cpp</code> and
        <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> are often in the same
        directory (e.g. <code>base/test_basictypes.cpp</code> and
        <code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but can be in different
        directories too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within each section it is nice to order the includes
        alphabetically.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the includes in

        <code>my-awesome-project/src/foo/internal/fooserver.cpp</code>
        might look like this:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        #include "foo/public/fooserver.h"  // Preferred location.

	#include "base/basictypes.h"
        #include "base/commandlineflags.h"
        #include "foo/public/bar.h"

        #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
        #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

        #include &lt;hash_map&gt;
        #include &lt;vector&gt;

<CATEGORY title="Scoping">
  <STYLEPOINT title="Namespaces">
    <SUMMARY>
      Unnamed namespaces in <code>.cpp</code> files are encouraged.  With
      named namespaces, choose the name based on the

      project, and possibly its path.
      Do not use a <SYNTAX>using-directive</SYNTAX> in a header file.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Namespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named
        scopes, and so are useful for preventing name collisions in
        the global scope.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        <p>
          Namespaces provide a (hierarchical) axis of naming, in
          addition to the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by
          classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if two different projects have a class
          <code>Foo</code> in the global scope, these symbols may
          collide at compile time or at runtime.  If each project
          places their code in a namespace, <code>project1::Foo</code>
          and <code>project2::Foo</code> are now distinct symbols that
          do not collide.

      <CONS>
        <p>
          Namespaces can be confusing, because they provide an
          additional (hierarchical) axis of naming, in addition to the
          (also hierarchical) name axis provided by classes.

        <p>
          Use of unnamed spaces in header files can easily cause
          violations of the C++ One Definition Rule (ODR).

      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Use namespaces according to the policy described below.
        </p>

        <SUBSECTION title="Unnamed Namespaces">
          <ul>
            <li> Unnamed namespaces are allowed and even encouraged in

                   However, file-scope declarations that are
                   associated with a particular class may be declared
                   in that class as types, static data members or
                   static member functions rather than as members of
                   an unnamed namespace.  Terminate the unnamed
                   namespace as shown, with a comment <code>//

  <STYLEPOINT title="Nested Classes">
    <SUMMARY>
      Although you may use public nested classes when they are part of
      an interface, consider a <a HREF="#Namespaces">namespace</a> to
      keep declarations out of the global scope.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        A class can define another class within it; this is also
        called a <SYNTAX>member class</SYNTAX>.
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          class Foo
          {
          private:
              // Bar is a member class, nested within Foo.
              class Bar
              {
                ...
              };

          };
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        This is useful when the nested (or member) class is only used
        by the enclosing class; making it a member puts it in the
        enclosing class scope rather than polluting the outer scope
        with the class name.  Nested classes can be forward declared
        within the enclosing class and then defined in the
        <code>.cpp</code> file to avoid including the nested class
        definition in the enclosing class declaration, since the
        nested class definition is usually only relevant to the
        implementation.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Nested classes can be forward-declared only within the
        definition of the enclosing class. Thus, any header file
        manipulating a <code>Foo::Bar*</code> pointer will have to
        include the full class declaration for <code>Foo</code>.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        Do not make nested classes public unless they are actually
        part of the interface, e.g., a class that holds a set of
        options for some method.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions">
    <SUMMARY>
      Prefer nonmember functions within a namespace or static member
      functions to global functions; use completely global functions
      rarely.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <PROS>
        Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some
        situations.  Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids
        polluting the global namespace.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as
        members of a new class, especially if they access external
        resources or have significant dependencies.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Sometimes it is useful, or even necessary, to define a
          function not bound to a class instance.  Such a function can
          be either a static member or a nonmember function.
          Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables,
          and should nearly always exist in a namespace.  Rather than
          creating classes only to group static member functions which
          do not share static data, use
          <a href="#Namespaces">namespaces</a> instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions defined in the same compilation unit as production
          classes may introduce unnecessary coupling and link-time
          dependencies when directly called from other compilation
          units; static member functions are particularly susceptible
          to this.  Consider extracting a new class, or placing the
          functions in a namespace possibly in a separate library.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you must define a nonmember function and it is only
          needed in its <code>.cpp</code> file, use an unnamed
          <a HREF="#Namespaces">namespace</a> or <code>static</code>
          linkage (eg <code>static int foo() {...}</code>) to limit
          its scope.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Local Variables">
    <SUMMARY>
      Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope possible,
      and initialize variables in the declaration.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        C++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a function.
        We encourage you to declare them in as local a scope as
        possible, and as close to the first use as possible. This
        makes it easier for the reader to find the declaration and see
        what type the variable is and what it was initialized to.  In
        particular, initialization should be used instead of
        declaration and assignment, e.g.
      </p>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        int i;
        i = f();      // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        int j = g();  // Good -- declaration has initialization.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Note that gcc implements <code>for (int i = 0; i
        &lt; 10; ++i)</code> correctly (the scope of <code>i</code> is
        only the scope of the <code>for</code> loop), so you can then
        reuse <code>i</code> in another <code>for</code> loop in the
        same scope.  It also correctly scopes declarations in
        <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements, e.g.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        while (char const* p = strchr(str, '/')) str = p + 1;
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        There is one caveat:  if the variable is an object, its
        constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is
        created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes
        out of scope.
      </p>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        // Inefficient implementation:
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i)
        {
            Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.
            f.do_something(i);
        }
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        It may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a
        loop outside that loop:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called once each.
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i)
        {
            f.do_something(i);

  Classes are the fundamental unit of code in C++. Naturally, we use
  them extensively. This section lists the main dos and don'ts you
  should follow when writing a class.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      The purpose of a constructor is to initialise a class so that its 
      invariants hold.  For value classes it is worth having a cheap default
      constructor.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        It is possible to perform initialization in the body of the
        constructor.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Convenience in typing.  No need to worry about whether the
        class has been initialized or not.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        The problems with doing work in constructors are:
        <ul>
          <li> If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will
               not get dispatched to the subclass implementations.
               Future modification to your class can quietly introduce
               this problem even if your class is not currently
               subclassed, causing much confusion.
          </li>
          <li> If someone creates a global variable of this type
               (which is against the rules, but still), the
               constructor code will be called before
               <code>main()</code>, possibly breaking some implicit
               assumptions in the constructor code.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        Constructors should not make virtual calls to functions, access 
        potentially uninitialized global variables, etc.
      </DECISION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Default Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      You must define a default constructor if your class defines
      member variables of POD types and has no other constructors.
      Otherwise the compiler will do it for you, badly.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        The default constructor is called when we create a
        class object with no arguments.  It is always called when
        calling <code>new[]</code> (for arrays).
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Initializing structures by default makes debugging much easier.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Extra work for you, the code writer.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          If your class defines POD member variables and has no other
          constructors you must define a default constructor (one that
          takes no arguments). It should initialize the
          object in such a way that its internal state is consistent
          and valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for this is that if you have no other
          constructors and do not define a default constructor, the
          compiler will generate one for you. This compiler
          generated constructor may not initialize your object
          sensibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class is composed from and/or inherits from an existing
          class or classes but you add no new member variables, you are
          not required to have a default constructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class has value semantics then consider making the
          class invariants such that the default constructor is cheap.
          For example, initialising member pointers to <code>nullptr</code>
          and allocating on first use.
        </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Explicit Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use the C++ keyword <code>explicit</code> for constructors with
      one argument.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Normally, if a constructor takes one argument, it can be used
        as a conversion.  For instance, if you define
        <code>Foo::Foo(string name)</code> and then pass a string to a
        function that expects a <code>Foo</code>, the constructor will
        be called to convert the string into a <code>Foo</code> and
        will pass the <code>Foo</code> to your function for you.  This
        can be convenient but is also a source of trouble when things
        get converted and new objects created without you meaning them
        to.  Declaring a constructor <code>explicit</code> prevents it
        from being invoked implicitly as a conversion.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Avoids undesirable conversions.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Avoids desirable conversions.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          We require all single argument constructors to be
          explicit. Always put <code>explicit</code> in front of
          one-argument constructors in the class definition:
          <code>explicit Foo(string name);</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The exception is copy constructors, which, in the rare
          cases when we allow them, should probably not be
          <code>explicit</code>.

          Classes that are intended to be
          transparent wrappers around other classes are also
          exceptions.
          Such exceptions should be clearly marked with comments.

      </DECISION>

  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Copy Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      Provide a copy constructor and assignment operator only when necessary.
      Otherwise, disable them with the help of <code>= delete;</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        The copy constructor and assignment operator are used to create copies
        of objects. The copy constructor is implicitly invoked by the
        compiler in some situations, e.g. passing objects by value.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Copy constructors make it easy to copy objects.  STL
        containers require that all contents be copyable and
        assignable. Copy constructors can be more efficient than
        <code>CopyFrom()</code>-style workarounds because they combine
        construction with copying, the compiler can elide them in some
        contexts, and they make it easier to avoid heap allocation.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Implicit copying of objects in C++ is a rich source of bugs
        and of performance problems. It also reduces readability, as
        it becomes hard to track which objects are being passed around
        by value as opposed to by reference, and therefore where
        changes to an object are reflected.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Few classes need to be copyable. Most should have neither a
          copy constructor nor an assignment operator. In many situations,
          a pointer or reference will work just as well as a copied value,
          with better performance. For example, you can pass function
          parameters by reference or pointer instead of by value, and you can
          store pointers rather than objects in an STL container.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class needs to be copyable, prefer providing a copy method,
          such as <code>CopyFrom()</code> or <code>Clone()</code>, rather than
          a copy constructor, because such methods cannot be invoked
          implicitly. If a copy method is insufficient in your situation
          (e.g. for performance reasons, or because your class needs to be
          stored by value in an STL container), provide both a copy
          constructor and assignment operator.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class does not need a copy constructor or assignment
          operator, you must explicitly disable them.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Structs vs. Classes">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use a <code>struct</code> only for passive objects that carry data;
      everything else is a <code>class</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        The <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> keywords behave
        almost identically in C++.  We add our own semantic meanings
        to each keyword, so you should use the appropriate keyword for
        the data-type you're defining.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>structs</code> should be used for passive objects that carry
        data, and may have associated constants, but lack any functionality
        other than access/setting the data members. The
        accessing/setting of fields is done by directly accessing the
        fields rather than through method invocations. Methods should
        not provide behavior but should only be used to set up the
        data members, e.g., constructor, destructor,
        <code>initialize()</code>, <code>reset()</code>,
        <code>validate()</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If more functionality is required, a <code>class</code> is more
        appropriate.  If in doubt, make it a <code>class</code>.

        For consistency with STL, you can use <code>struct</code>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Inheritance">
    <SUMMARY>
      Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance.  When
      using inheritance, make it <code>public</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        When a sub-class inherits from a base class, it includes the
        definitions of all the data and operations that the parent
        base class defines.  In practice, inheritance is used in two
        major ways in C++: implementation inheritance, in which
        actual code is inherited by the child, and <A HREF="#Interfaces">interface inheritance</A>, in which only
        method names are inherited.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Implementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using the
        base class code as it specializes an existing type.  Because
        inheritance is a compile-time declaration, you and the
        compiler can understand the operation and detect errors.
        Interface inheritance can be used to programmatically enforce
        that a class expose a particular API.  Again, the compiler
        can detect errors, in this case, when a class does not define
        a necessary method of the API.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        For implementation inheritance, because the code implementing
        a sub-class is spread between the base and the sub-class, it
        can be more difficult to understand an implementation.  The
        sub-class cannot override functions that are not virtual, so
        the sub-class cannot change implementation.  The base class
        may also define some data members, so that specifies physical
        layout of the base class.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          All inheritance should be <code>public</code>.  If you want to
          do private inheritance, you should be including an instance of
          the base class as a member instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not overuse implementation inheritance.  Composition is
          often more appropriate. Try to restrict use of inheritance
          to the "is-a" case: <code>Bar</code> subclasses
          <code>Foo</code> if it can reasonably be said that
          <code>Bar</code> "is a kind of" <code>Foo</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make your destructor <code>virtual</code> if necessary. If
          your class has virtual methods, its destructor

          should be virtual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limit the use of <code>protected</code> to those member
          functions that might need to be accessed from subclasses.
          Note that <a href="#Access_Control">data members should
          be private</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When redefining an inherited virtual method (both pure
          and non-pure), explicitly declare it <code>override</code>
          in the declaration of the derived class. Rationale: using
          <code>override</code> allows the compiler to consistently
          detect attempts to override methods that have been changed
          or completely removed. It also makes it straightforward for
          a reader to determine if a method is virtual or not.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Multiple Inheritance">
    <SUMMARY>
      Only very rarely is multiple inheritance of implementation
      actually useful.  We allow multiple inheritance only when at most one of
      the base classes has an implementation; all other base classes
      must be <A HREF="#Interfaces">interface</A> classes.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Multiple inheritance allows a sub-class to have more than one
        base class.  We distinguish between base classes that are
        <em>interfaces</em> and those that have an <em>implementation</em>.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Multiple implementation inheritance may let you re-use even more code
        than single inheritance (see <a HREF="#Inheritance">Inheritance</a>).
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Only very rarely is multiple <em>implementation</em>
        inheritance actually useful. When multiple implementation
        inheritance seems like the solution, you can usually find a
        different, more explicit, and cleaner solution.

        Multiple inheritance is allowed only when all superclasses, with the

    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        <p>
        A class is an interface if it meets the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> It has only public pure virtual ("<code>= 0</code>") methods
               and static methods (but see below for destructor).
               </li>
          <li> It may not have non-static data members.
               </li>
          <li> It need not have any constructors defined.  If a constructor is
               provided, it must take no arguments and it must be protected.
               </li>
          <li> If it is a subclass, it may only be derived from classes

          An interface class can never be directly instantiated
          because of the pure virtual method(s) it declares.  To make
          sure all implementations of the interface can be destroyed
          correctly, they must also declare a virtual, or protected, destructor (in
          an exception to the first rule, this should not be pure).  See

      Overload operators where appropriate.

    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        A class can define that operators such as <code>+</code> and
        <code>/</code> operate on the class as if it were a built-in
        type.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Can make code appear more intuitive because a class will
        behave in the same way as built-in types (such as
        <code>int</code>).  Overloaded operators are more playful
        names for functions that are less-colorfully named, such as
        <code>equals()</code> or <code>add()</code>.  For some
        template functions to work correctly, you may need to define
        operators.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        While operator overloading can make code more intuitive, it
        has several drawbacks:
        <ul>
          <li> It can fool our intuition into thinking that expensive
               operations are cheap, built-in operations.
               </li>
          <li> It is much harder to find the call sites for overloaded
               operators.  Searching for <code>Equals()</code> is much
               easier than searching for relevant invocations of
               <code>==</code>.
               </li>
          <li> Some operators work on pointers too, making it easy to
               introduce bugs.  <code>Foo + 4</code> may do one thing,
               while <code>&amp;Foo + 4</code> does something totally
               different. The compiler does not complain for either of
               these, making this very hard to debug.
               </li>
        </ul>
        Overloading also has surprising ramifications.  For instance,
        if a class overloads unary <code>operator&amp;</code>, it
        cannot safely be forward-declared.
      </CONS>

    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Your class definition should start with its <code>public:</code>
        section, followed by its <code>protected:</code> section and
        then its <code>private:</code> section. If any of these sections
        are empty, omit them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within each section, the declarations generally should be in
        the following order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Typedefs and Enums</li>
        <li> Constants (<code>static const</code> data members)</li>

        <li> Data Members (except <code>static const</code> data members)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Friend declarations should always be in the private section, and
        the <code>DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN</code> macro invocation
        should be at the end of the <code>private:</code> section. It
        should be the last thing in the class. See <a HREF="#Copy_Constructors">Copy Constructors</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Method definitions in the corresponding <code>.cpp</code> file

        We recognize that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so
        no hard limit is placed on functions length. If a function

  <STYLEPOINT title="Reference Arguments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Most parameters passed by reference should be labeled
      <code>const</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        In C, if a function needs to modify a variable, the
        parameter must use a pointer, eg <code>int foo(int
        *pval)</code>.  In C++, the function can alternatively
        declare a reference parameter: <code>int foo(int&amp; val)</code>.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Defining a parameter as reference avoids ugly code like
        <code>(*pval)++</code>.  Necessary for some applications like
        copy constructors.  Makes it clear, unlike with pointers, that
        <code>NULL</code> is not a possible value.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        References can be confusing, as they have value syntax but
        pointer semantics.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Within function parameter lists all references must be
          <code>const</code>:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          void foo(string const&amp; in, string* out);
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          In fact it is a very strong convention in Unity code that input
          arguments are values or <code>const</code> references while output
          arguments are pointers.  Input parameters may be <code>const</code>
          pointers. Non-<code>const</code> reference parameters are allowed
          but there must be a valid reason for it, a strong preference is
          given to <code>const</code> reference parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          One case when you might want an input parameter to be a
          <code>const</code> pointer is if you want to emphasize that the
          argument is not copied, so it must exist for the lifetime of the
          object; it is usually best to document this in comments as
          well.  STL adapters such as <code>bind2nd</code> and
          <code>mem_fun</code> do not permit reference parameters, so
          you must declare functions with pointer parameters in these
          cases, too.

      <PROS>
        Overloading can make code more intuitive by allowing an
        identically-named function to take different arguments.  It
        may be necessary for templatized code, and it can be
        convenient for Visitors.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        If a function is overloaded by the argument types alone, a
        reader may have to understand C++'s complex matching rules in
        order to tell what's going on.  Also many people are confused
        by the semantics of inheritance if a derived class overrides
        only some of the variants of a function.

      <DECISION>
        If you want to overload a function, consider qualifying the
        name with some information about the arguments, e.g.,

        Often you have a function that uses lots of default values,

        define many functions for the rare exceptions.

      <CONS>
        People often figure out how to use an
        API by looking at existing code that uses it.
        Default parameters are more difficult to maintain because
        copy-and-paste from previous code may not reveal all the
        parameters.  Copy-and-pasting of code segments can cause major
        problems when the default arguments are not appropriate for
        the new code.

        Friends should usually be defined in the same file so that the

        <code>friend</code> is to have a <code>FooBuilder</code> class
        be a friend of <code>Foo</code> so that it can construct the
        inner state of <code>Foo</code> correctly, without exposing
        this state to the world.  In some cases it may be useful to
        make a unit test class a friend of the class it tests.

        Friends extend, but do not break, the encapsulation

        The problem with C casts is the ambiguity of the operation;

  <STYLEPOINT title="Streams">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use streams only for logging.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Streams are a replacement for <code>printf()</code> and
        <code>scanf()</code>.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        With streams, you do not need to know the type of the object
        you are printing.  You do not have problems with format
        strings not matching the argument list.  (Though with gcc, you
        do not have that problem with <code>printf</code> either.)  Streams
        have automatic constructors and destructors that open and close the
        relevant files.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Streams make it difficult to do functionality like
        <code>pread()</code>.  Some formatting (particularly the common
        format string idiom <code>%.*s</code>) is difficult if not
        impossible to do efficiently using streams without using
        <code>printf</code>-like hacks.  Streams do not support operator
        reordering (the <code>%1s</code> directive), which is helpful for
        internationalization.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>

        <p>
          Do not use streams, except where required by a logging interface.
          Use <code>printf</code>-like routines instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various pros and cons to using streams, but in
          this case, as in many other cases, consistency trumps the
          debate.  Do not use streams in your code.
        </p>

        <SUBSECTION title="Extended Discussion">
          <p>
            There has been debate on this issue, so this explains the
            reasoning in greater depth.  Recall the Only One Way
            guiding principle: we want to make sure that whenever we
            do a certain type of I/O, the code looks the same in all
            those places.  Because of this, we do not want to allow
            users to decide between using streams or using
            <code>printf</code> plus Read/Write/etc.  Instead, we should
            settle on one or the other.  We made an exception for logging
            because it is a pretty specialized application, and for
            historical reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proponents of streams have argued that streams are the obvious
            choice of the two, but the issue is not actually so clear.  For
            every advantage of streams they point out, there is an
            equivalent disadvantage.  The biggest advantage is that
            you do not need to know the type of the object to be
            printing.  This is a fair point.  But, there is a
            downside: you can easily use the wrong type, and the
            compiler will not warn you.  It is easy to make this
            kind of mistake without knowing when using streams.
          </p>
          <CODE_SNIPPET>
            cout &lt;&lt; this;  // Prints the address
            cout &lt;&lt; *this;  // Prints the contents
          </CODE_SNIPPET>
          <p>
            The compiler does not generate an error because
            <code>&lt;&lt;</code> has been overloaded.  We discourage
            overloading for just this reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some say <code>printf</code> formatting is ugly and hard to
            read, but streams are often no better.  Consider the following
            two fragments, both with the same typo.  Which is easier to
            discover?
          </p>
          <CODE_SNIPPET>
             cerr &lt;&lt; "Error connecting to '" &lt;&lt; foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.first
                  &lt;&lt; ":" &lt;&lt; foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.second &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; strerror(errno);

             fprintf(stderr, "Error connecting to '%s:%u: %s",
                     foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.first, foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.second,
                     strerror(errno));
          </CODE_SNIPPET>
          <p>
            And so on and so forth for any issue you might bring up.
            (You could argue, "Things would be better with the right
            wrappers," but if it is true for one scheme, is it not
            also true for the other?  Also, remember the goal is to
            make the language smaller, not add yet more machinery that
            someone has to learn.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Either path would yield different advantages and
            disadvantages, and there is not a clearly superior
            solution.  The simplicity doctrine mandates we settle on
            one of them though, and the majority decision was on
            <code>printf</code> + <code>read</code>/<code>write</code>.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Preincrement and Predecrement">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use prefix form (<code>++i</code>) of the increment and
      decrement operators with iterators and other template objects.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        When a variable is incremented (<code>++i</code> or
        <code>i++</code>) or decremented (<code>--i</code> or
        <code>i--</code>) and the value of the expression is not used,
        one must decide whether to preincrement (decrement) or
        postincrement (decrement).
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        When the return value is ignored, the "pre" form
        (<code>++i</code>) is never less efficient than the "post"
        form (<code>i++</code>), and is often more efficient.  This is
        because post-increment (or decrement) requires a copy of
        <code>i</code> to be made, which is the value of the
        expression.  If <code>i</code> is an iterator or other
        non-scalar type, copying <code>i</code> could be expensive.
        Since the two types of increment behave the same when the
        value is ignored, why not just always pre-increment?
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        The tradition developed, in C, of using post-increment when
        the expression value is not used, especially in <code>for</code>
        loops.  Some find post-increment easier to read, since the
        "subject" (<code>i</code>) precedes the "verb" (<code>++</code>),
        just like in English.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        For simple scalar (non-object) values there is no reason to
        prefer one form and we allow either.  For iterators and other
        template types, use pre-increment.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Use of const">
    <SUMMARY>
      We strongly recommend that you use <code>const</code> whenever
      it makes sense to do so.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Declared variables and parameters can be preceded by the
        keyword <code>const</code> to indicate the variables are not
        changed (e.g., <code>int const foo</code>).  Class functions
        can have the <code>const</code> qualifier to indicate the
        function does not change the state of the class member
        variables (e.g., <code>class Foo { int bar(char c) const;
        };</code>).
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Easier for people to understand how variables are being used.
        Allows the compiler to do better type checking, and,
        conceivably, generate better code.  Helps people convince
        themselves of program correctness because they know the
        functions they call are limited in how they can modify your
        variables.  Helps people know what functions are safe to use
        without locks in multi-threaded programs.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <code>const</code> is viral: if you pass a <code>const</code>
        variable to a function, that function must have <code>const</code>
        in its prototype (or the variable will need a
        <code>const_cast</code>).  This can be a particular problem
        when calling library functions.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          <code>const</code> variables, data members, methods and
          arguments add a level of compile-time type checking; it
          is better to detect errors as soon as possible.
          Therefore we strongly recommend that you use
          <code>const</code> whenever it makes sense to do so:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> If a function does not modify an argument passed by
               reference or by pointer, that argument should be
               <code>const</code>.
               </li>
          <li> Declare methods to be <code>const</code> whenever
               possible. Accessors should almost always be
               <code>const</code>. Other methods should be const if they do
               not modify any data members, do not call any
               non-<code>const</code> methods, and do not return a
               non-<code>const</code> pointer or non-<code>const</code>
               reference to a data member.
               </li>
          <li> Consider making data members <code>const</code>
               whenever they do not need to be modified after
               construction.
               </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, do not go crazy with <code>const</code>.  Something like
          <code>int const* const* const x;</code> is likely
          overkill, even if it accurately describes how const x is.
          Focus on what's really useful to know: in this case,
          <code>int const** x</code> is probably sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>mutable</code> keyword is allowed but is unsafe
          when used with threads, so thread safety should be carefully
          considered first.
        </p>
      </DECISION>
      <SUBSECTION title="Where to put the const">
        <p>
          We favor the form <code>int const* foo</code> to
          <code>const int* foo</code>.  This keeps the <code>const</code>
          with the type modifier (&amp; or *).
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, while we encourage putting <code>const</code> after the type,
          we do not require it.  But be consistent with the code around
          you!

            Note that the <code>PRI*</code> macros expand to independent
            strings which are concatenated by the compiler. Hence
            if you are using a non-constant format string, you
            need to insert the value of the macro into the format,
            rather than the name. It is still possible, as usual,
            to include length specifiers, etc., after the
            <code>%</code> when using the <code>PRI*</code>
            macros. So, e.g.  <code>printf("x = %30"PRIuS"\n",
            x)</code> would expand on 32-bit Linux to
            <code>printf("x = %30" "u" "\n", x)</code>, which the
            compiler will treat as <code>printf("x = %30u\n",
            x)</code>.
          </p>

          </li>

        <li> Remember that <code>sizeof(void*)</code> !=
             <code>sizeof(int)</code>.  Use <code>intptr_t</code> if
             you want a pointer-sized integer.
             </li>

        <li> You may need to be careful with structure alignments,
             particularly for structures being stored on disk. Any
             class/structure with a

             <code>int64_t</code>/<code>uint64_t</code>
             member will by default end up being 8-byte aligned on a 64-bit
             system. If you have such structures being shared on disk
             between 32-bit and 64-bit code, you will need to ensure
             that they are packed the same on both architectures.

             Most compilers offer a way to alter
             structure alignment.  For gcc, you can use
             <code>__attribute__((packed))</code>.  MSVC offers
             <code>#pragma pack()</code> and
             <code>__declspec(align())</code>.

        <li>

             Use the <code>LL</code> or <code>ULL</code> suffixes as
             needed to create 64-bit constants.  For example:

             <CODE_SNIPPET>
             int64_t my_value = 0x123456789LL;
             uint64_t my_mask = 3ULL &lt;&lt; 48;
             </CODE_SNIPPET>
             </li>

        <li> If you really need different code on 32-bit and 64-bit
             systems, use <code>#ifdef _LP64</code> to choose between
             the code variants. (But please avoid this if
             possible, and keep any such changes localized.)

        Macros mean that the code you see is not the same as the code

        Luckily, macros are not nearly as necessary in C++ as they are

        store a constant, use a <code>const</code> variable.  Instead of

        header files).  It makes testing much more difficult.

        Macros can do things these other techniques cannot, and you do
        see them in the codebase, especially in the lower-level
        libraries.  And some of their special features (like
        stringifying, concatenation, and so forth) are not available
        through the language proper.  But before using a macro,
        consider carefully whether there's a non-macro way to achieve
        the same result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following usage pattern will avoid many problems with
        macros; if you use macros, follow it whenever possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Don't define macros in a <code>.h</code> file.
             </li>
        <li> <code>#define</code> macros right before you use them,
             and <code>#undef</code> them right after.
             </li>
        <li> Do not just <code>#undef</code> an existing macro before
             replacing it with your own; instead, pick a name that's
             likely to be unique.
             </li>
        <li> Try not to use macros that expand to unbalanced C++
             constructs, or at least document that behavior well.
             </li>
        <li> Prefer not using <code>##</code> to generate function/class/variable
             names.

<CATEGORY title="Naming">
  <p>
    The most important consistency rules are those that govern
    naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of
    thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a
    constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the
    declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in our
    brains relies a great deal on these naming rules.

  </p>
  <p>
    Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but

    we feel that consistency is more important than individual preferences
    in this area, so regardless of whether you find them sensible or not,
    the rules are the rules.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="General Naming Rules">
    <SUMMARY>
      Function names, variable names, and filenames should be
      descriptive; eschew abbreviation.  Types and variables should be
      nouns, while functions should be "command" verbs.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="How to Name">
        <p>
          Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do
          not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more
          important to make your code immediately understandable by a
          new reader. Examples of well-chosen names:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          int num_errors;                  // Good.
          int num_completed_connections;   // Good.
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          Poorly-chosen names use ambiguous abbreviations or arbitrary
          characters that do not convey meaning:
        </p>
        <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
          int n;                           // Bad - meaningless.
          int nerr;                        // Bad - ambiguous abbreviation.
          int n_comp_conns;                // Bad - ambiguous abbreviation.
        </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          Type and variable names should typically be nouns: e.g.,
          <code>FileOpener</code>,

          <code>num_errors</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Function names should typically be imperative (that is they
          should be commands): e.g., <code>open_file()</code>,
          <code>set_num_errors()</code>.  There is an exception for
          accessors, which, described more completely in <a HREF="#Function_Names">Function Names</a>, should be named
          the same as the variable they access.

      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Abbreviations">
        <p>

        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          // Good
          // These show proper names with no abbreviations.
          int num_dns_connections;  // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.

      uses. If there is no consistent local pattern to follow, prefer "_".

          test_myusefulclass.cpp  // _unittest and _regtest are deprecated.<br/>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ files should end in <code>.cpp</code> and header files
        should end in <code>.h</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not use filenames that already exist
        in <code>/usr/include</code>, such as <code>db.h</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, make your filenames very specific.  For example,
        use <code>http_server_logs.h</code> rather
        than <code>logs.h</code>.  A very common case is to have a
        pair of files called, e.g., <code>foo_bar.h</code>
        and <code>foo_bar.cpp</code>, defining a class
        called <code>FooBar</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inline functions must be in a <code>.h</code> file. If your
        inline functions are very short, they should go directly into your
        <code>.h</code> file. However, if your inline functions
        include a lot of code, they may go into a third file that
        ends in <code>-inl.h</code>.  In a class with a lot of inline
        code, your class could have three files:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        url_table.h      // The class declaration.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Function Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Declaration comments describe use of the function; comments at

    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="Function Declarations">
        <p>
          Every function declaration should have comments immediately
          preceding it that describe what the function does and how to
          use it.  These comments should be descriptive ("Opens the
          file") rather than imperative ("Open the file"); the comment
          describes the function, it does not tell the function what
          to do.  In general, these comments do not describe how the
          function performs its task.  Instead, that should be left to
          comments in the function definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Types of things to mention in comments at the function
          declaration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> What the inputs and outputs are.
               </li>
          <li> For class member functions:  whether the object
               remembers reference arguments beyond the
               duration of the method call, and whether it will
               free them or not.
               </li>
          <li> If the function allocates memory that the caller
               must free.
               </li>
          <li> Whether any of the arguments can be <code>NULL</code>.
               </li>
          <li> If there are any performance implications of how a
               function is used.
               </li>
          <li> If the function is re-entrant.  What are its
               synchronization assumptions?
               </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here is an example:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          // Returns an iterator for this table.  It is the client's
          // responsibility to delete the iterator when it is done with it,
          // and it must not use the iterator once the GargantuanTable object
          // on which the iterator was created has been deleted.
          //
          // The iterator is initially positioned at the beginning of the table.
          //
          // This method is equivalent to:
          //    Iterator* iter = table-&gt;new_iterator();
          //    iter-&gt;seek("");
          //    return iter;
          // If you are going to immediately seek to another place in the
          // returned iterator, it will be faster to use new_iterator()
          // and avoid the extra seek.
          Iterator* get_iterator() const;
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          However, do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the
          completely obvious.  Notice below that it is not necessary
          to say "returns false otherwise" because this is implied.
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          // Returns true if the table cannot hold any more entries.
          bool is_table_full();
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          When commenting constructors and destructors, remember that
          the person reading your code knows what constructors and
          destructors are for, so comments that just say something like
          "destroys this object" are not useful.  Document what
          constructors do with their arguments (for example, if they
          take ownership of pointers), and what cleanup the destructor
          does.  If this is trivial, just skip the comment.  It is
          quite common for destructors not to have a header comment.
        </p>
      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Function Definitions">
        <p>
          Each function definition should have a comment describing
          what the function does if there's anything tricky about how it does
          its job.  For example, in the definition comment you might
          describe any coding tricks you use, give an overview of the
          steps you go through, or explain why you chose to implement
          the function in the way you did rather than using a viable
          alternative.  For instance, you might mention why it must
          acquire a lock for the first half of the function but why it
          is not needed for the second half.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note you should <em>not</em> just repeat the comments given
          with the function declaration, in the <code>.h</code> file or
          wherever.  It's okay to recapitulate briefly what the function

      <SUBSECTION title="Class Data Members">

          Each class data member (also called an instance variable or

          used for.  If the variable can take sentinel values with
          special meanings, such as <code>NULL</code> or -1, document this.
          For example:

          As with data members, all global variables should have a

      <SUBSECTION title="Line Comments">
        <p>
          Also, lines that are non-obvious should get a comment at the
          end of the line. These end-of-line comments should be
          separated from the code by 2 spaces.  Example:
        </p>

          // If we have enough memory, mmap the data portion too.
          mmap_budget = max&lt;int64&gt;(0, mmap_budget - index_-&gt;length());

        Comments should usually be written as complete
        sentences with proper capitalization and periods at the end.
        Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of
        code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be
        consistent with your style.  Complete sentences are more
        readable, and they provide some assurance that the comment is
        complete and not an unfinished thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point
        out that you are using a comma when you should be using a
        semicolon, it is very important that source code maintain a
        high level of clarity and readability.  Proper punctuation,

        identifier
        of the person who can best provide context about the problem
        referenced by the <code>TODO</code>.  A colon is optional.  The main
        purpose is to have a consistent <code>TODO</code> format that can be
        searched to find the person who can provide more details upon request.
        A <code>TODO</code> is not a commitment that the person referenced

      You can mark an interface as deprecated by writing a comment containing

      A deprecation comment must include simple, clear directions for people to

      <p>
      Marking an interface point <code>DEPRECATED</code> will not magically

    Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a

      <p>
        We recognize that this rule is controversial, with so much
        existing code already adhering to a maximum line length of 80
        characters. However, we favor sensible naming of variables and
        functions over the limit of 80 characters.

      <PROS>
          Those who favor

          this rule argue
          that it is rude to force them to resize their windows and there
          is no need for anything longer.  Some folks are used to having
          several code windows side-by-side, and thus don't have room to
          widen their windows in any case.  People set up their work
          environment assuming a particular maximum window width, and 80
          columns has been the traditional standard.  Why change it? 
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
          Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code
          more readable.  The 80-column limit is an hidebound
          throwback to 1960s mainframes;

          modern equipment has

      <p>
        You shouldn't hard-code user-facing text in source, even English,
        so use of non-ASCII characters should be rare.  However, in certain
        cases it is appropriate to include such words in your code.  For
        example, if your code parses data files from foreign sources,
        it may be appropriate to hard-code the non-ASCII string(s) used in
        those data files as delimiters.  More commonly, unit test code
        (which does not

        need to be localized) might contain non-ASCII strings.  In such
        cases, you should use UTF-8, since that is

        an encoding understood by most tools able
        to handle more than just ASCII.
        Hex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it enhances
        readability &#8212; for example, <code>"\xEF\xBB\xBF"</code> is the
        Unicode zero-width no-break space character, which would be
        invisible if included in the source as straight UTF-8.

        <li> There is never a space between the parentheses and the

             or return type.
       </li>
        <li> The close curly brace is either on the last line by itself
             or (if other style rules permit) on the same line as the
             open curly brace.
       </li>
        <li> All parameters should be named, with identical names in the

             are suppressed in the implementation.)

        <li> All parameters should be in a single line if possible, otherwise:

                spaces.

            </ul>
        </li>

      <p>
        If your function is <code>const</code>, the <code>const</code>

        conditional or loop statements with complex conditions or

      Constructor initializer lists can be all on one line or with
      subsequent lines indented four spaces.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        There are three acceptable formats for initializer lists:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // When it all fits on one line:
        MyClass::MyClass(int var) : some_var_(var), some_other_var_(var + 1) {}
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // When it requires multiple lines, indent 4 spaces, putting the colon on
        // the constructor declaration line and commas at the end of the line.
        MyClass::MyClass(int var) :
            some_var_(var),            // 4 space indent
            some_other_var_(var + 1)
        {
            ...
            do_something();
            ...
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // When it requires multiple lines, indent 4 spaces, putting the colon on
        // the first initializer line and commas at the end of the line.
        MyClass::MyClass(int var)
            : some_var_(var),            // 4 space indent
              some_other_var_(var + 1)
        {
            ...
            do_something();
            ...
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Namespace Formatting">
    <SUMMARY>
      The contents of namespaces are not indented.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        <a href="#Namespaces">Namespaces</a> do not add an extra level of
        indentation. For example, use:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        namespace
        {

        void foo()  // Correct.  No extra indentation within namespace.
        {
            ...
        }

        }  // namespace
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Do not indent within a namespace:
      </p>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        namespace
        {

          // Wrong.  Indented when it should not be.
          void foo()
          {
            ...
          }

        }  // namespace
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        When declaring nested namespaces, put each namespace on its own line,
        with the opening brace on the line following.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        namespace foo
        {
        namespace bar
        {
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Horizontal Whitespace">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use of horizontal whitespace depends on location.  Never put trailing
      whitespace at the end of a line.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="General">
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
        int i = 0;        // Semicolons usually have no space before them.
        int x[] = { 0 };  // Spaces inside braces for array initialization are
        int x[] = {0};    // optional.  If you use them, put them on both sides!

        // Spaces around the colon in inheritance and initializer lists.
        class Foo : public Bar
        {
        public:
            // For inline function implementations, put spaces between the braces
            // and the implementation itself.
            Foo(int b) : Bar(), baz_(b) {}  // No spaces inside empty braces.
            void reset() { baz_ = 0; }  // Spaces separating braces from implementation.
            ...
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          Adding trailing whitespace can cause extra work for others editing
          the same file, when they merge, as can removing existing trailing
          whitespace.  So:  Don't introduce trailing whitespace.  Remove it
          if you're already changing that line, or do it in a separate
          clean-up

          operation (preferably when no-one else
          is working on the file).

        x = -5;             // No spaces separating unary operators and their
        ++x;                // arguments.

        v = w*x + y/z;      // but it's okay to remove spaces around factors.
        v = w * (x + z);    // Parentheses should have no spaces inside them.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Vertical Whitespace">
    <SUMMARY>
      Minimize use of vertical whitespace but apply it to enhance readability.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This is more a principle than a rule: don't use blank lines
        when you don't have to.  In particular, don't put more than
        one or two blank lines between functions, resist starting
        functions with a blank line, don't end functions with a blank
        line, and be discriminating with your use of blank lines
        inside functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen,
        the easier it is to follow and understand the control flow of
        the program.  Of course, readability can suffer from code
        being too dense as well as too spread out, so use your
        judgement.  But in general, minimize use of vertical
        whitespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function very
             rarely help readability.
             </li>
        <li> Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well
             help readability.
             </li>
      </ul>

<CATEGORY title="Exceptions to the Rules">
  <p>
    The coding conventions described above are mandatory.  However,
    like all good rules, these sometimes have exceptions, which we
    discuss here.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Existing Non-conformant Code">
    <SUMMARY>
      You may diverge from the rules when dealing with code that does not
      conform to this style guide.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        If you find yourself modifying code that was written to
        specifications other than those presented by this guide, you may
        have to diverge from these rules in order to stay consistent with
        the local conventions in that code.  If you are in doubt about
        how to do this, ask the original author or the person currently
        responsible for the code.  Remember that <em>consistency</em>
        includes local consistency, too.

    Use common sense and <em>BE CONSISTENT</em>.

  <p>
    If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the
    code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces
    around their <code>if</code> clauses, you should, too. If
    their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make
    your comments have little boxes of stars around them too.
  </p>
  <p>
    The point of having style guidelines is to have a common
    vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are
    saying, rather than on how you are saying it.  We present
    global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But
    local style is also important.  If code you add to a file
    looks drastically different from the existing code around it,
    the discontinuity throws readers out of their rhythm when they
    go to read it. Try to avoid this.
  </p>

  <p>
    OK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much
    more interesting. Have fun!
