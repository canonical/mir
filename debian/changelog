mir (0.1.6-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 0.1.6 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.1.6)
    - mirserver ABI bumped to 16.
    - Server API changes:
      . Report classes have moved to new namespaces/components. Please
        consult the server headers.
      . General clean-ups and virtual function changes affecting the ABI
        (a rebuild is required for all shells).
    - mirclient ABI unchanged, still at 7. Clients do not need rebuilding.
    - Add new feature: Screen recording ("screencasting") as demonstrated by
      the new mir-util "mirscreencast".
    - debian: Provide platform packages managed with dpkg alternatives.
    - Add new valgrind suppressions (mostly for armhf right now)
    - tools: Add new libmirclientplatform.so to install_on_android.sh.
    - Add "mir_demo_standalone_render_overlays", which is a free-standing
      example of overlay support.
    - Proper DisplayConfiguration for the AndroidDisplay to be better 
      prepared for multi-monitor Android.

      has now absorbed SurfaceData.
    - Dynamically load the client platform library.
    - Bugs fixed:
      . Exceptions thrown from within compositing threads were untraceable,
        resulting in a bunch of undebuggable crash reports (LP: #1237332)
      . Ensure we close drm device file descriptors on exec. (LP: #1284081)
      . nested render_surfaces fails on N4 [std::exception::what: Failed to

        bug, use a dummy thead_local array to push the gl/egl context TLS 
        into a region where the future wait code does not overwrite it. 
        (LP: #1280086)
      . compositor: calling SwitchingBundle::force_requests_to_complete()
        can be a no-op when there are no requests. (LP: #1281145)

mir (0.1.4+14.04.20140204-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.1.4 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.1.4)
    - Fixed snapshotting and flicker problems for Unity8 on various Nexus
      devices.
    - Enhanced reporting of performance information:
      . Report input latency in InputReport/InputReceiverReport.
      . Added a CompositorReport for logging compositor performance and state.
    - Added a new package "mir-utils" containing new tools:
      . mirping: Displays round-trip times between client and server
      . mirout: Displays the monitor layout/configuration details
    - Added GL texture caching to improve performance when multiple surfaces
      are visible.
    - Added opacity controls to mir_demo_server_shell
    - Mir server ABI bumped to 13. Client ABI bumped to 5.
    - Removed lots of Android headers, replaced by build-dep: android-headers
    - Added support for translucent nested servers.
    - tests: Fix unitialized values and incorrect fd closing loops
    - Fix unitialized values and incorrect fd closing loops.
    - client: Add basic MirScreencast C API.
    - config: start moving default values for config options from all the
      call sites to the setup
    - tests: Provide a helper for running clients with a stub ClientPlatform.
    - android: split out HWC layers into their own file and add a
      mga::CompositionLayer type that depends on the interface mg::Renderable.
    - client: Add basic MirOutputCapture class.
    - client: Don't create mesa ClientBuffer objects from invalid
      MirBufferPackages.
    - Optimize surface resizing to avoid doing anything if the dimensions
      are unchanged.
    - SwitchingBundle - add operator<< for debugging.
    - support hwcomposer 1.2 for android 4.4 on nexus 4 (which needs hwc1.2
      support). This patch adds hwc1.2 device construction, as well as progs
      the 'skip' layer in HWC to the buffer properties of the framebuffer.
    - demo-shell: Add simple keyboard controls to rotate outputs; Ctrl +
      Alt + <arrow-key>. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1203215.
    - frontend: exposing internals of the RPC mechanism to enable custom
      function calls to be added.
    - Make udev wrapper into a top-level citizen
    - compositor: ignore double requests to start or stop the
      MultiThreadedCompositor.
    - Add DisplayBuffer::orientation(), to tell the Renderer if we need it
      to do screen rotation in GL (for platforms which don't implement 
      rotation natively) Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1203215.
    - graphics: add an post_update function that takes a list of renderables
      to the display buffer. This will let the display buffer take advantage
      of full-surface overlays on android.
    - android-input: Improve debug output
    - the stock qcom 8960 hwcomposer chokes on getDisplayAttributes if the
      submitted arrays are not at least size 6. patched the qcom android 4.2
      hwcomposer driver on the ubuntu touch images to work properly, but
      causes us problems with in-the wild drivers, and the new 4.4 drivers.
      Make sure we always submit a larger-than-needed array to this function.
    - frontend: refactoring to make it easier to expose the underlying RPC
      transport on the server side.
    - Don't assume pressure value is zero if not yet known
    - build: Expose options to allow building but not running tests by default.
    - Translucent Server which prefers a transparent pixel format
    - frontend: refactor ProtobufMessageProcessor to separate out generic
      response sending logic from specific message handling.
    - client: expose the part of the client RPC infrastructure needed for
      downstream to prototype their own message sending.
    - Bugs fixed:
      . unity8 display flickers and stops responding on Nexus 7 (grouper)
        (LP: #1238695)
      . Mir gets textures/buffers confused when running both scroll and flicker
        demos (LP: #1263592)
      . Some snapshots on Nexus10 upside-down (LP: #1263741)
      . mir_unit_tests is crashing with SIGSEGV in libhybris gl functions
        (LP: #1264968)
      . Some snapshots on Nexus10 have swapped red/blue channels (LP: #1265787)
      . Bypass causes some non-bypassed surfaces (on top) to be invisible
        (LP: #1266385)
      . helgrind: Possible data race - MirConnection::mutex not used
        consistently (LP: #1243575)
      . helgrind: Lock order violated (potential deadlock) in
        ConnectionSurfaceMap (LP: #1243576)
      . helgrind: Possible data race - inconsistent locking in PendingCallCache
        (LP: #1243578)
      . helgrind: Lock order violated in
        mir::client::ConnectionSurfaceMap::erase(int) (LP: #1243584)
      . [enhancement] Allow a Mir nested server to have a transparent
        background (LP: #1256702)
      . Compiling without tests fails (-DMIR_ENABLE_TESTS=NO) (LP: #1263724)
      . examples, doc: Make it clear and consistent how to use
        a non-root client with a root compositor endpoint. 
        (LP: #1272143)
      . Avoid linking to umockdev on platforms (android) which don't yet
        use it. This allows mir_unit_tests to run on touch images again
        (LP: #1271434)
      . Workaround for N4 nested server issue. This change removes
        mir_pixel_format_bgr_888 - HAL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB_888 from the
        list of supported pixel formats on android. (LP: #1272041)
      . Don't ask glUniformMatrix4fv to transpose your matrix. That option
        was officially deprecated between OpenGL and OpenGL|ES. And some
        drivers like the Nexus 10 don't implement it, resulting in incorrect
        transformations and even nothing on screen! (LP: #1271853)
      . Fixes: bug 1272143 (LP: #1272143)
      . fix integration test failure on the galaxy nexus that was due to
        creating two surfaces and registering the same buffer twice. Fixes:
        (LP: #1272597)
      . Implement screen rotation in GLRenderer, for platforms
        which can't do it natively in DisplayBuffer.
        (LP: #1203215)
      . Add an "orientation" field to output structures in preparation for
        screen rotation. It's not yet functionally wired to anything.
        (LP: #1203215)
      . Only use SwitchingBundle::last_consumed after it has been
        set. Otherwise SwitchingBundle::compositor_acquire could follow a bogus
        code path. (LP:#1270964)
      . tests: Override configuration to avoid creating an (unused)
        filesystem endpoint for connections when using InProcessServer. 
        (LP: #1271604)
      . frontend: ensure that BasicConnector threads don't exit
        immediately. (LP: #1271655)

  [ Kevin Gunn ]
  * New upstream release 0.1.2
    - graphics: android: improve interface for mga::DisplayDevice so its
      just concerned with rendering and posting.
    - surfaces: rename "surfaces" component to "scene".
    - surfaces, shell: Migrate Session data model from shell to surfaces.
    - graphics: change fill_ipc_package() to use real pointers.
    - mir_client_library.h: Fix typo "do and locking" should be "do any
      locking".
    - API enumerations cleanup: Remove slightly misleading *_enum_max_
      values, and replace them with more accurate plural forms.
    - test_android_communication_package: Do not expect opened fd to be >0,
      we may have closed stdin making this a valid value (LP: #1247718).
    - Update docs about running Mir on the desktop to mention new package
      ubuntu-desktop-mir.
    - offscreen: Add a display that renders its output to offscreen buffers
    - graphics: android: fix regression for hwc1.0 devices introduced in r1228
      (LP: #1252433).
    - OffscreenPlatform provides the services that the offscreen display
      needs from the Platform.
    - graphics: android: consolidate the GLContexts classes in use.
    - Fix uninitialized variable causing random drm_auth_magic test
      failures. (LP: #1252144).
    - Add a fullyish functional Udev wrapper. This currently sits in
      graphics/gbm, but will be moved to the top-level when input device
      detection migrates.
    - Add resizing support to example code; demo-shell and clients.
    - eglapp: Clarify messages about pixel formats (LP: #1168304).
    - Adds support to the MirMotionEvent under pointer_coordinates called
      tool_type. This will allow clients to tell what type of tool is
      being used, from mouse/finger/etc. (LP: #1252498)
    - client,frontend: Report the real available surface pixel formats to
      clients. (LP: #1240833)
    - graphics: android: 1) change hwc1.1 to make use of sync fences during
      the compositor's gl renderloop. Note that we no longer wait for the
      render to complete, we pass this responsibility to the driver and the
      kernel. 2) support nexus 10. (LP: #1252173) (LP: #1203268)
    - shell: don't publish SurfacesContainer - it can be private to shell.
    - gbm: Don't mess up the VT mode on setup failure Only restore the
      previous VT mode during shutdown if it was VT_AUTO.
    - Fix a crash due to a failed eglMakeCurrent() call when in nested mode.
    - shell: unity-mir uses shell::FocusSetter - make the header public again
    - Add resize support to client surfaces (mir::client::MirSurface).
    - graphics: android: support 'old aka 2012' nexus 7 hwc (nvidia tegra3
      SoC) better. (LP: #1231917)
    - Add resize support to *ClientBuffer classes. Now always get dimensions
      from the latest buffer package.
    - android: support driver hooks for the Mali T604 (present in nexus 10)
    - Add width and height to the protocol Buffer messages, in preparation
      for resizable surfaces.
    - surfaces, shell, logging, tests: don't publish headers
      that can be private to surfaces. surfaces/basic_surface.h,
      surfaces/surface_controller.h and shell/surface_builder.h
    - examples: Restore GL framebuffer binding when destroying the render
      target
    - examples, surfaces, shell: remove render_surfaces dependency on
      BasicSurface
    - geometry: remove implementation of streaming operators from headers
      (LP: #1247820)
    - Eliminate the registration order focus sequence, folding it's
      functionality in to the session container.
    - Ensure the session mediator releases acquired buffer resources before
      attempting to acquire a new buffer on behalf of the client. This fixes
      performance regression (LP: #1249210).
    - Some cleanups to test_client_input.cpp.
    - Factor out a bunch of "ClientConfigCommon".
    - Small cleanup to session container test to increase encapsulation.
    - shell, surfaces: Another step in "fixing" the surfaces hierarchies -
      only publish interfaces and putting the data model into surfaces.
    - graphics: android: HWC1.1 use EGL to get further information about
      the framebuffer pixel format.
    - Fix FTBS using use_debflags=ON (building for android-armhf).
      (LP: #1248014)
    - Add a client input receiver report.
    - doc: doxygen 1.8.4 complains about an obsolete config so ran "doxygen
      u Doxyfile.in".
    - Implement resize() for the server-side Surface classes.
    - android: clean up mga::DisplayBuffer and mga::DisplayBufferFactory
    - Add resize() support to BufferStream, in preparation for resizable
      surfaces.
    - Merge metadata changes from the newly reconstructed lp:mir
    - tests: Deduplicate mg::GraphicBufferAllocator stubs.
    - examples: Remove spurious use of mir/shell/surface.h.
    - frontend: remove ClientTrackingSurface from the Surface class
      hierarchy
    - Bumping ABI on server to libmirserver11.
    - Don't mention "Renderable". That interface hasn't existed for quite
      some time now.
    - android-input: Assign more unique touch ids

  * client: Remove the timeout for detecting server crashes There are
    valid cases when the server blocks for an indeterminate amount of
    time during a client request, like when a next_buffer request blocks
    because a surface is not visible or the server is paused. In such
    cases, the timeout mechanism we used to detect server crashes caused
    the clients to fail. Furthermore, the clients seem able to detect
    server crashes without the timeout, rendering it needless anyway.

  * Bump version 0.1.0
  * Add method for testing if Rectangle::contains(Rectangle), which is
    the basis of any occlusion detection. (LP: #1227739)
  * Add support for traversing the Scene from front surface to back.
    This is required for occlusion detection at least (coming soon). .
    (LP: #1227739)
  * Optimization: Turn off blending for surfaces that are not blendable.
    On some systems this can have a noticeable performance benefit.
  * Avoid rendering surfaces that are fully hidden by other surfaces.
    This is particularly important for mobile device performance. (LP:
    #1227739) . (LP: #1227739)
  * Remove orphaned tags, which appear to have come from the Compiz
    project (!?) Add tags for the most recent releases up to 0.0.16. No
    files changed, only tags.
  * Fix significant performance issues LP: #1241369 / LP: #1241371, and
    probably more(!) Added regression test to catch such regressions and
    revert the offending commit r1049. (LP: #1241369, #1241371)

  [ Brandon Schaefer ]
  * When Scroll events come in we don't keep around the android vscroll
    hscroll data. Store it now. (LP: #1233089)

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Fix mismatched free() / delete / delete [] reported by valgrind

  [ Alexandros Frantzis ]
  * server: Extend server status (formerly pause/resume) listener to
    report "started" events This change is needed by users of
    libmirserver, so they can properly synchronize external interactions
    with the server. (LP: #1239876)
  * graphics,examples: Don't enable more outputs than supported when
    changing the display configuration. (LP: #1217877)
  * client: Allow clients to call API functions after a connection break
    has been detected When a client tries to call an API function after
    a connection break has been detected in a previous API call, the
    client blocks in the new call. This happens because in
    MirSocketRpcChannel::notify_disconnected() the pending RPC calls are
    not forced to complete, since the channel has already been marked as
    'disconnected' by the failure in the previous call. Note that if the
    break is first detected while calling an API function, then that
    call doesn't block, since this is the first time we call
    MirSocketRpcChannel::notify_disconnected() and the pending RPC calls
    are forced to complete. This commit solves this problem by always
    forcing requests to complete when a communication failure occurs,
    even if a disconnection has already been handled. This is preferred
    over the alternative of manually calling the completion callback in
    a try-catch block when calling an RPC method because of: 1.
    Correctness: In case the communication problem first occurs in that
    call, the callback will be called twice, once by
    notify_disconnected() and once manually. 2. Consistency: The
    callback is called from one place regardless of whether the
    communication problem is first detected during that call or not.
    (LP: #1201436)
  * graphics: Improve signature of native platform initialization method
    Use an interface to provide the functionality needed by native
    platforms.

  [ Eleni Maria Stea ]
  * Test GBMBufferAllocatorTest.bypass_disables_via_environment
    overrides the MIR_BYPASS env variable, causing other tests that use
    the MIR_BYPASS to fail when we run the unit-tests with --
    gtest_repeat=N, N>1. Set back the MIR_BYPASS env. var. (LP:
    #1238000)

  [ Kevin DuBois ]
  * fix: lp 1239577 TestClientIPCRender (an android-only gfx driver
    test) was hanging due to changes in signal handling. refactor the
    test, changing the cross-process sync mechanism so it doesn't use
    sigcont. (LP: #1239577)
  * graphics: android: eliminate one of the two DisplayBuffers. both
    hwc/gpu displays use the same displaybuffer now. .

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Add InputReader performance test.

  [ Alan Griffiths ]
  * logging: correct component tag in connector report.
  * client: fix hang(s) in client API when server dies. (LP: #1227743)
  * Fix failing acceptance-test:
    ServerShutdown/OnSignal.removes_endpoint_on_signal (LP: #1237710)
    Avoid fatal_signal_cleanup getting caught in a loop restoring itself
    and then re-entering itself. This could happen in some permutations
    of acceptance-tests where run_mir is entered with
    fatal_signal_cleanup already set up from previous tests' server
    instances. (LP: #1237710)
  * CMake: remove creation of link to non-existent file.
  * shared: some utility functions to provide some consistent ways to
    use RAII and application of these functions to some code that has
    had RAII related discussions recently.
  * config: separate out the configuration options from the
    configuration builder.
  * config: ensure USC can access
    DefaultConfigurationOptions::parse_options (LP: #1244192) (LP:

  * SwitchingBundle: Simplify and clarify guarantees that
    compositor_acquire always has a buffer to return without blocking or
    throwing an exception. The trade-off is that to enforce the
    guarantee we need to permanently reserve one buffer for compositing.
    This reduces the flexibility of SwitchingBundle a little, such that
    minimum nbuffers is now 2. This was originally requested by
    Alexandros, as the potential throw concerned him. Although, it was
    logically guaranteed to never happen for other reasons. The second
    reason for doing this is to eliminate recycling logic, which while
    safe and correct, was quite confusing. So this change further proves
    that that logic (now removed) is not to blame for frame ordering
    bugs. .

  * Fix server-side tracking of client buffers When the server knows the
    client has a given buffer cached it only needs to send the BufferID
    rather than the full IPC package. While this is an optimisation,
    it's also required for correctness - the client will not clean up
    fds for buffers it has cached, so if the server sends a full IPC
    package for a buffer the client knows about any buffer fds leak. The
    buffer cache is per-surface on the client side, but was per-session
    on the server side. This meant that the server did not accurately
    track the client's buffers, resulting in it sending unexpected fds
    that the client then leaked. Fix this by making the buffer tracker
    per-surface server-side.

mir (0.0.8+13.10.20130809.3-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * Simplify and generalize buffer swapping to support arbitrary numbers
    of: - buffers - compositors - clients This is a unified N-buffers
    algorithm which supports any positive number of buffers, as well as
    dynamically switching between synchronous and asynchronous
    behaviour. So it does everything the existing code does and more.
    The key requirement is to support an arbitrary number of (different)
    simultaneous compositor acquisitions, as is needed for bypass
    support (coming soon). This then leads to the requirement that a
    compositor and a snapshot buffer should be acquired differently.
    Because a snapshot should never consume frames, only observe them.
    On the other hand, a compositior acquire must consume a frame (if
    available) so as to guarantee correct ordering when more than one
    are acquired simultaneously in bypass mode. Also fixes LP: #1199717
    and is half the fix for LP: #1199450. (LP: #1199450, #1199717)

  * unify advance_client_buffer and client_buffer() interfaces on
    ms::Surface. change the ms::Surface class so that it does not hold
    the client resource on behalf of the clients, the frontend or native
    windows do.
  * android drivers have an interface for the drivers to obtain a strong
    reference to the native window type. Allow the drivers to acquire
    this strong reference to the buffer backing their texture/fbo.
  * Activate sending a "swapinterval" signal over IPC. Add client api
    for software clients to request different swapintervals.
    (eglSwapInterval is not glued together just yet) Currently only
    swapinterval of 0 or 1 is supported. (LP: #1130553)
  * link eglSwapInterval hook in gbm driver to the ipc message to enable
    swapinterval0. This makes eglSwapInterval (1) or (0) work for gbm
    ipc clients only.
  * fix: lp:1196647 (test bug results in crash in android unit tests)
    bug was just in test code on android. (LP: #1196647)
  * fix: lp1192742 by cleaning up FD's when an android client
    unregisters its native_handle_t. (LP: #1192742)
  * saucy's default boost version is 1.53, yet the cross compile script
    was still on 1.49. switch script to 1.53.
  * begin cleanup of ms::Surface by breaking "ms::Surface : public
    mi::SurfaceTarget" inheritance the input system was using the
    surface object (specifically the std::weak_ptr<mi::SurfaceTarget> to
    the ms::Surface) as its 'key' for coordinating the surfaces. This
    bound the input system tightly to the surface stack, which prevented
    any proxying of ms::Surface and made the lifetime of ms::Surface
    tangled. This change breaks this dependency by making ms::Surface
    own an InputChannel, instead of it being a SurfaceTarget.
  * remove google mock from the internal source tree. Rather, use the
    google-mock package and build the source externally. (LP: #1185265,
    #1194017)
  * disable running the integration test suite on arm architecture
    during the packaging builds (lp: #1195265). (LP: #1195265, #1195260)
  * break ms::Surface : public mg::Renderable dependency, paving the way
    for a more sensible interface surrounding our ms::Surface object.
    Also ensure that graphics data is maintained synchronously. Remove
    most state from ms::Surface.
  * fixes: lp:1200782 by freeing fd's associated with buffer package.

  * Cache the transformation matrix; only recalculate it when some part
    of the transformation changes. (LP: #1193020) . (LP: #1193020)
  * Don't pass a clang-only option to gcc. It will not understand and
    cause build failure (LP: #1194385). (LP: #1194385)
  * Fix build failure due to differing exception specifiers. noexcept
    destructors should be enforced in derived classes if the base uses
    them. (LP: #1194703). (LP: #1194703)
  * Document thread safety pitfalls about client-side callbacks. .
  * Fix mismatched destructor exception specifiers causing build failure
    in gcc 4.7. Also fix struct/class mismatches that some compilers
    will treat as an error. (LP: #1196415). (LP: #1196415)
  * mir_demo_client_unaccelerated: Add an FPS count, and a "-n" option
    to disable vsync (set swap interval to 0).
  * mir_demo_client_egl*: Add a "-n" option to disable syncing to vblank
    (hence to use swap interval == 0).
  * Initial attempts at making the Mir client API thread safe.
    Ordinarily you would not build locking into an API, however the fact
    that Mir clients implicitly get multiple threads created for them
    makes it important for the API itself to be automatically thread
    safe. I've tried to avoid API changes, but adding a new function:
    mir_wait_for_one was necessary. This is because mir_wait_for doesn't
    work if multiple threads are waiting on the same thing
    simultaneously. And the fact that waiting at all is optional means
    we can't change the behaviour of mir_wait_for -- it must always wait
    for all outstanding results (which is only safe in clients where the
    waiting happens in a single thread). .
  * Work around GCC issue 50043 which is causing build failures on
    raring. (LP: #1199210) The gcc bug is only fixed in 4.8/saucy. (LP:
    #1199210)
  * MockDisplayConfigurationPolicy: Work around gcc-4.7 bugs causing
    build failure on raring. (LP: #1200064). (LP: #1200064)
  * Another workaround for gcc-4.7 bugs causing build failure. (LP:
    #1200107). (LP: #1200107)
  * buffer_swapper_spin.h: Remove dead code: initialize_queues.
  * Remove unused interface surfaces::GraphicRegion It became unused
    when Kevin's work landed in r856 yesterday. .
  * Rename compositor::Renderables --> compositor::Scene What is a
    "Renderables"? It's the interface by which we know the scene graph,
    or the model of how all the surfaces relate to each other. Right,
    then call it a scene graph... but the word "graph" might imply a
    particular structure. And we don't want to imply such things in an
    interface. So just call it "scene". That makes slightly more sense
    than imagining what a "Renderables" (singular) is.
  * Fix comments which mention incorrect namespaces for Buffer following
    yesterday's landings.
