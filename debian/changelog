  * New upstream release 0.31.1(https://github.com/orgs/MirServer/projects/3)

    - ABI summary:
      . mirclient ABI unchanged at 9
      . miral ABI unchanged at 3
      . mirserver ABI unchanged at 46

    - Enhancements:
    - Bugs fixed:
      . Fix a couple of warnings from g++ 8.0.1
      . src/miral/CMakeLists.txt has some hardcoded compile flags.
        These should be inherited from the parent project instead. (Fixes #266)
      . [Wayland] Subcompositor fixes: subsurface offset issue and sync behavior
      . [Wayland] stopped frame.done being called if frame has been destroyed
      . [Wayland] Implement WlSurface::set_cursor(): Enable Wayland clients to
        set and hide the cursor
      . [Wayland] Configure new surfaces after attaching observers: For tiling,
        we need to set the surface state to "maximized" so that Wayland clients
        obey exactly. That wasn't working as the wayland_frontend wasn't being
        notified of the actual state.
      . [Wayland] Don't remember recent surface events after the input
        dispatcher is stopped: The event "goes stale" and can cause a segfault.
        (Fixes #276)
      . [Wayland] Sequence xdg-top-level and xdg-surface configure events
        correctly: qtwayland gets confused by receiving these event out of
        order. (Fixes #280)

mir (0.26.1+17.04.20170209.1-0ubuntu1) zesty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 0.26.1 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.26.1)
    - ABI summary:
      . mirclient ABI unchanged at 9
      . mirserver ABI unchanged at 43
      . mircommon ABI unchanged at 7
      . mirplatform ABI bumped to 15
      . mirprotobuf ABI unchanged at 3
      . mirplatformgraphics ABI bumped to 12
      . mirclientplatform ABI unchanged at 5
      . mirinputplatform ABI unchanged at 6
      . mircore ABI unchanged at 1
    - Enhancements:
      . Support for MirBuffer API that allows for better management of
        hardware/software buffers.
      . Support for MirPresentationChain API that allows better control
        over {de}queueing of individual buffers {from}to the server.
      . Interim support for MirRenderSurface API that provides a unit of
        renderable for lower level content such as MirBufferStreams and
        MirPresentationChains, etc.. MirRenderSurface API is marked
        deprecated as it (and the relevant entry points) will be renamed to
        MirSurface before general availability. It will initially be used for
        revamping support for EGL drivers.
      . Synchronous version of mir_prompt_session_new_fds_for_prompt_providers()
        API (mir_prompt_session_new_fds_for_prompt_providers_sync()) added for
        convenience.
      . Better name for MirPersistentId-->MirWindowId. MirPersistentId has now
        been deprecated.
    - Bugs fixed:
      . [regression] Unity8 stutters constantly (like half frame rate).
        (LP: #1661128)
      . mir 0.26 - spinner loading animation, minimize, maximize too fast.
        (LP: #1661072)
      . [regression] Nested server segfaults or rapidly logs exceptions when a
        fullscreen client starts [in mir_presentation_chain_set_dropping_mode
        ... std::exception::what: Operation not permitted] (LP: #1661508)
      . mir_window_request_persistent_id_sync seg faults when called twice.
        (LP: #1661704)
      . [regression] Windowed clients of nested servers are all black.
        (LP: #1661521)
      . Mir graphics platform ABI broke in series 0.26 but sonames never
        changed (LP: #1662455)
      . Fixes for 0.26 changelog.
      . [regression] mirscreencast hangs during screencast creation. (LP: #1662997)
      . libmirclient-dev missing build dependency on libmircore-dev. (LP: #1662942)
      . mir_window_spec_set_cursor_name() doesn't trigger
        mir::scene::SurfaceObserver::cursor_image_set_to. (LP: #1663197)
      . [regression] Software clients of nested servers are all black in Mir 0.25.0
        and later. (LP: #1663062)

mir (0.26.0+17.04.20170126.3-0ubuntu1) zesty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 0.26.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.26.0)
    - ABI summary:
      . mirclient ABI unchanged at 9
      . mirserver ABI bumped to 43
      . mircommon ABI unchanged at 7
      . mirplatform ABI unchanged at 14
      . mirprotobuf ABI unchanged at 3
      . mirplatformgraphics ABI unchanged at 11
      . mirclientplatform ABI unchanged at 5
      . mirinputplatform ABI unchanged at 6
      . mircore ABI unchanged at 1
    - Enhancements:
      . New and improved client APIs: MirInputConfig, MirWindow, DisplayConfig,
        MirScreencastSpec.
      . Support for setting the input configuration.
      . Introduced an extension mechanism for platform-specific APIs.
      . Support for screencasting to a specific MirBuffer.
      . Added DisplayConfigurationController::base_configuration() so
        downstreams can get the base configuration (weirdly they can already
        set it).
      . X11 platform: Allow adjustable scale parameter.
      . Added monitor EDID support to both the client API and server-side.
      . mirout: Now shows scaling factor, subpixel arrangement, form factor and
        EDID.
      . mirout: Can now change the monitor configuration as well as report it.
      . Replace the mir::Server-overridable Reports with Observers.
      . Deprecate legacy toolkit APIs that will be removed in Mir 1.0
      . Introduced client-side vsync which dramatically reduces latency
        from the client to the screen, by up to 44ms.
      . Removed all input resampling logic. We now expect toolkits to do their
        own, if at all. This reduces input lag by up to 16.9ms, or 8.4ms on
        average.

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.15.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.15.0)
    - ABI summary: Only servers and graphics drivers need rebuilding;
      . Mirclient ABI unchanged at 9
      . Mirserver ABI bumped to 33
      . Mircommon ABI unchanged at 5
      . Mirplatform ABI bumped to 9
    - Enhancements:
      . Add support for Mir-on-X11.
      . Latency reduction optimizations (around ~15ms reduction in total):
        Reduced input event resampling latency by 5ms. Reduced output latency
        (in system compositors) by around 10ms with the introduction of
        "predictive bypass". And we're not finished; future Mir releases
        should reduce latency further.
      . Introduced a python3-based Mir performance framework.
      . Lots of preparation for an architectural overhaul of buffer swapping,
        required in the least to support future optimizations like nested
        bypass.
      . Added a new cursor: crosshair
      . Added support for 15/16-bit client pixel formats ("high colour").
      . Added a new client function to make picking the right pixel format
        for a given EGLConfig super simple: mir_connection_get_egl_pixel_format
      . Added application-not-responding detection
      . Added client API for specifying input region shape.
      . Fixed the remaining threading flaws identified by ThreadSanitizer and
        turned it on permanently for all continuous integration in future.
      . Added support for relative pointer motion events (e.g. for gaming).
    - Bug fixes:
      . Fix focus issues breaking autopilot tests entering text (LP: #1468029)
      . Fix mir tests failure on armhf with GCC5 (LP: #1478213)

  [ Alan Griffiths ]
  * New upstream release 0.13.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.13.0)
    - Very large release as the previous 0.12 series contained only minimal
      bug fixes...
    - Enhancements:
      . New demo clients for input testing: mir_demo_client_eglsquare and
        mir_demo_client_target.
      . Demo clients: mir_demo_client_tooltip, mir_demo_client_animated_cursor
      . mir_demo_client_fingerpaint now processes input asynchronously to
        drawing for a more fluid experience.
      . New, default window manager in mir_demo_server
      . mir_demo_server option (--arw-file) to make socket filename globally rw
      . mir_demo_server demonstrates use of config file
      . Added support to mir_proving_server for rendering window title strings
      . Demo servers (mir_proving_server, mir_demo_server): Introduce support
        for Alt+` switching of windows in multi-window clients.
      . Added client API support for constructing input method surfaces.
      . Introduce "buffer streams" properly. This is a generalization of the
        most basic functionality of a surface.
      . Log useful OpenGL information on server start-up.
      . Add support for HWC 1.4
      . Add display and fencing information to the layers in the HWC report
      . Add a report_vsync method to display report
      . Support for second display when running on "android" driver stack
      . Server buffering strategy is configurable by --nbuffers=N
        (or environment MIR_SERVER_NBUFFERS=N)
      . Explicit support for configuring window management in libmirserver.
      . Remove surface configurator & placement strategy configuration points
      . Added experimental environment variable MIR_CLIENT_INPUT_RATE=Hz for
        tweaking the input resampling rate a client experiences (0 = off).
        Also raised the default input rate from 55Hz to 59Hz for visibly
        smoother touch scrolling.
      . Added keymap setting support for surfaces.
      . Improved automated testing of latency.
      . Replaced and rewrote automated ABI checking.
      . New client APIs for basic window management; setting window titles,
        self-resizing, size constraints and changing type.
      . Introduced dynamically loadable input platforms.
      . Work towards libinput integration
      . Added proof-of-concept support for Snappy packaging for Ubuntu Core.
      . Drop support for C++11. Now C++14 is required to build Mir.
      . Deprecated MirEventDelegate. Now you just pass the two fields as
        parameters directly to mir_surface_set_event_handler().
      . Legacy functions for creating surfaces marked deprecated
      . Minor redesign of the new input event API introduced in 0.10/11,
        so that identifiers are shorter and less convoluted.
      . Drop libmirclient dependency on client-platform drivers
      . Drop libmirserver dependency on client-platform drivers
      . Use the ABI version in platform library names and packages
      . Rework to reduce "abstraction leaks" in the graphics platform
      . Add thread sanitizer build option
      . Update KVM Instructions
      . Update CMAKE to use CMAKE_*_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
    - ABI summary: Servers need rebuilding, but clients do not;
      . Mirclient ABI unchanged at 8

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.11.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.11.0)
    - Packaging changes:
      . Due to changes in the Mir driver model the client platforms are no
        longer versioned by soname. Thusly libmirplatform5driver-(mesa|android) is
        replaced by mir-client-platform-(mesa-android). A new package
        mir-client-platform-mesa-dev is introduced containing headers
        previously in mirplatform-dev.
    - Enhancements:
      . Lots more major plumbing in the Android code, on the path to
        supporting external displays.
      . Add support for clang 3.6.
      . Major redesign of server classes in mir::shell,scene and friends
        (still in progress).
      . Added client API for creating dialogs and tooltips.
      . Added new surface states: mir_surface_state_hidden and
        mir_surface_state_horizmaximized.
      . Performance: Use optimally efficient fragment shading when possible.
      . Performance: (Desktop) Composite using double buffering instead of
        triple to reduce visible lag.
      . mir_proving_server: Can now resize windows from any edge or corner
        using the existing Alt+middlebuttondrag.
      . mir_proving_server: Added some demo custom shaders (negative and
        high contrast modes: Super+N/C).
      . mir_proving_server: Can now close clients politely via Alt+F4.
      . Added MirPointerInputEvent (part of the new input API, the old
        MirMotionEvent is still supported also for now).
    - ABI summary: Servers need rebuilding, but clients do not;
      . Mirclient ABI unchanged at 8

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.8.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.8.0)
    - Enhancements:
      . Less sensitivity to ABI breaks - many headers unused by external
        projects are now hidden and not installed by -dev packaes. If you
        require any headers that are missing, just ask.
      . Touchspots: --enable-touchspots to servers; visually shows touch
        locations (warning: This affects performance LP: #1373692).
      . Client performance reporting: Any Mir client can now get accurate
        performance information (frame rate, render time, buffer lag etc)
        logged to stdout. Just set env MIR_CLIENT_PERF_REPORT=log
      . Further improved touch responsiveness, with less lag and smoother
        scrolling (so long as you don't enable touchspots).
      . Slightly faster builds using precompiled headers.
      . Turn hardware overlays on by default. When in use, this halves the
        CPU usage of a Mir server. Already enabled in unity-system-compositor.
      . More scripting to detect ABI breaks.
      . Improved src/ tree consistency (renamed "src/shared" to "src/common").
      . Improved fatal signal design: Changed from SIGTERM to SIGHUP delivered
        to clients on unexpected server disconnection.
      . Improved library/package design to allow concurrent installations
        of different Mir versions without conflicts.
      . Fd reception code is now common to client and server.
    - ABI summary: Servers need rebuilding, but clients do not;
      . Mirclient ABI unchanged at 8
      . Mircommon ABI bumped to 2
      . Mirplatform ABI bumped to 3
      . Mirserver ABI bumped to 26
    - API changes between Mir 0.7 and 0.8:
      . Lots of headers removed from the public SDK! We have only hidden
        headers not known to be used by any known projects. Please let us
        know if anything is missing - https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+filebug
      . graphics::Platform - interface changed significantly.
      . Lots of server API changes to support touchspots.
      . File descriptors now passed as type Fd instead of int32_t.

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.7.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.7.0)
    - Enhancements:
      . Test suite: Reworked mechanism to override Mir client functions
      . Demo shell: Detect custom rendering (decorations) to make it
        compatible with overlay optimizations
      . Make sure to preserve fd resources until the end of the sending
        of the message
      . Add test cases and script for tracking changes to the new ABIs:
        libmircommon, libmirplatform
      . Symbols file for libmirplatform
      . Symbols file for libmircommon
      . Symbols file for libmirserver
      . Various improvements to the SessionMediator test
      . Various build related improvements
      . Print testcase output during package build
      . Abort test when InProcessServer startup fails
      . Link the integration and unit tests against the server objects
      . Add a document detailing the useful tests to run and the useful
        logs to collect when troubleshooting a new android chipset
      . Enable motion event resampling and prediction for a more responsive
        touch experience.
    - ABI summary: Servers need rebuilding, but clients do not
      . Mirclient ABI unchanged at 8
      . Mircommon ABI bumped to 1

        If you have the std::shared_ptr<frontend::Session> session, you can
        just do session->create_surface(params) instead to get a SurfaceId.
      . mirplatform: class BufferID has been replaced with a typedef. Also,
        the BufferIPCPacker interface has changed slightly [pack_fd()].

        drawn (LP: #1348330)
      . Client: Fix SIGTERM dispatch in our default lifecycle event handler
        (LP: #1353867)
      . DemoRenderer: Don't try to create a texture of width zero. 
        (LP: #1358210)
      . Fix CI failures (LP: #1358698)
      . Fix build failure: "variable ‘rc’ set but not used" which happens in
        release mode when NDEBUG is set (LP: #1358625)
      . Only enumerate exposed input surfaces to avoid delivering events to
        occluded surfaces (LP: #1359264)
      . Android: do not post driver cancelled buffers (LP: #1359406)
      . Client: Ensure our platform library stays loaded for as long as it is
        needed by other objects (LP: #1358191)
      . Examples: Register the DemoCompositor with the Scene to properly
        process visibility events (LP: #1359487)
      . mir_demo_client_basic: Don't assert on user errors like failing to
        connect to a Mir server (LP: #1331958)
      . Tests: Explicitly depend on GMock target to avoid build races
        (LP: #1362646)

mir (0.2.0+14.10.20140605-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.2.0 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.2.0)
    - mirclient ABI unchanged, still at 7. Clients do not need rebuilding.
    - mirserver ABI bumped to 20. Shells need rebuilding.
      . Cursor::set_image() parameters changed.
      . Display::the_cursor() renamed to Display::create_hardware_cursor()
      . Platform::create_display() requires a new parameter; gl_program_factory
      . Renderable::buffer() no longer accepts any parameter at all. Multi-
        monitor frame sync is guaranteed in other ways now.
      . Scene::generate_renderable_list() renamed to renderable_list_for(id)
        where id is an opaque compositor ID of your choosing.
      . Scene::set_change_callback() replaced by the more generic:
        add_observer() and remove_observer() functions.
      . Added default implementation for SceneObserver.  
      . SessionCreator renamed to ConnectionCreator.
      . ConnectedSessions renamed to Connections.
      . ProtobufSessionCreator renamed to ProtobufConnectionCreator.
      . SessionAuthorizer: pid_t parameters replaced by SessionCredentials.
      . Massive architectural changes to Input-everything.
      . Surface no longer implements Renderable, but emits one via
        compositor_snapshot().
      . Pass the full renderable list to Renderer::render().
      . Graceful handling of exceptions thrown from server threads.
      . Clarify size position interfaces in the Surface classes.
      . Plumbing for trusted sessions.
      . Allow posting and managing custom main-loop actions.
      . Timer extension.
      . Identify client process when client connects to Mir not when socket
        connects.
      . Use the ServerActionQueue for display config.
      . Recomposition signal moved to the MultiThreadedCompositor.
      . Make timer service replaceable.
      . Clarify assumptions about how many buffers a client can fill without
        blocking.
      . Introduce EmergencyCleanup interface.
    - Demo shell enhancements:
      . You can now change graphics modes on the fly using Ctrl+Alt+(-/=).
        To reset to the preferred mode use Ctrl+Alt+0.
      . The above mode changing as well as existing screen rotation keys
        (Ctrl+Alt+arrows) are now per-display; only applied to the monitor
        the mouse pointer is on.
      . New shell controls documented.
    - A new testing category, performance test, was introduced. It currently
      runs glmark2-es2 and compares the result to a minimum threshold. 
    - MIR_VERSION_MINOR is tied to MIRSERVER_ABI in the sense that a change
      in the former now requires dependent projects that a rebuild is 
      necessary.
    - SwitchingBundle was replaced by BufferQueue.
    - Expand credentials to include uid/gid for session authorizer.
    - Bypass control is now Mesa-specific and tied to the command line options.
      So the environment variable MIR_BYPASS has changed to MIR_SERVER_BYPASS.
    - Ongoing architectural changes in the compositor/renderer logic to
      prepare for overlay support, and to reduce locking overhead.
    - Made InputDispatcher replaceable.
    - Progress made on new cursor interfaces with the end goal of client and
      toolkit control of the mouse cursor appearance. More work required.
    - Updated cross-compile docs and scripts to support the latest utopic
      devel images.
    - Replaced uses of android::sp with std::shared_ptr.
    - Client cursor API infrastructure.
    - Enabled eglSwapInternal(0).
    - Make texture caching algorithm reuseable.
    - Add a DPI surface attribute.
    - Exclude arm64 from build.
    - Bugs fixed:

      . [regression] tests/unit-tests/shell/test_mediating_display_changer.cpp
        is not compiled and executed. (LP: #1312832)
      . Android platform does not reset the compositionType to HWC_FRAMEBUFFER
        before prepare() on every frame. (LP: #1314399)
      . The client process is identified when the socket connects, not when the
        client connects to Mir. (LP: #1314574)

    - Added an id() to Renderable.
    - Scene/Renderer interfaces:
      . Scene is no longer responsible for its own iteration (no for_each
        any more). Instead you should iterate over the list returned by

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.1.8 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.1.8)
    - mirclient ABI unchanged, still at 7. Clients do not need rebuilding.
    - mirserver ABI bumped to 18. Shells need rebuilding.
    - Server API changes affecting shells:
      . GLRenderer::tessellate() changed syntax.
      . graphics::Platform::create_display() has a new parameter allowing you
        to customize the compositor's (E)GL configutation.
      . Renderable::buffer(unsigned long frameno) is now:
        Renderable::buffer(void const* user_id). See below.
      . Renderable::should_be_rendered_in() is replaced by a more natural:
        Renderable::visble()
      . input::Surface::name() returns by value instead of reference now,
        to ensure future thread safety.
    - Switched EventHub device enumeration and hotplug to Udev. NOTE! This
      means mir_test_* can't run natively on touch devices any more without
      some setup first:
        sudo mount -o remount,rw /
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y umockdev
        umockdev-run -- bin/mir_unit_tests
    - Added logging for HWC events.
    - Continued consolidation of Surface classes toward a simpler architecture.
    - Introduced "RenderableList" as the way to sample the Scene contents,
      and started using that in the default compositor.
    - Introduced physical length units and conversion (geometry::Length) in
      preparation for arbitrary DPI rendering.
    - Added some decorations to demo-shell; shadows and basic title bars, all
      anti-aliased and high-DPI scalable.
    - Multi-monitor frame sync has been redesigned to eliminate the need for
      frame number tracking.
    - Bugs (and enhancements) resolved:
      . [enhancement] Please move input detection to libudev (LP: #1237784)
      . [enhancement] Add a clamping resize mode to GLRenderer (LP: #1259887)

      . "Error opening DRM device" is always followed by "Unknown error -(some
        negative number)" (LP: #1292384)
      . Rendering/composition gets stopped early (LP: #1293896)
      . Ubuntu Touch Settings and terminal apps are not rendering correctly on

        test failures (LP: #1295231)
      . OSK touch events "fall through" and hit surface behind them
        (LP: #1297878)
      . [enhancement] add a test for composite of last client post
        (LP: #1298596)
      . [regression] Surfaces vanish as soon as their edges touch the edge of
        screen (LP: #1301115)

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.1.7 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.1.7)
    - mirserver ABI bumped to 17
    - mirclient ABI unchanged, still at 7. Clients do not need rebuilding.
    - Server API changes (AKA why doesn't my code build any more?):
      . Class "CompositingCriteria" has been removed. It's replaced by the more
        flexible "Renderable" interface. This also resulted in parameter
        changes for the Renderer and scene filtering classes.
      . The function "DisplayConfiguration::configure_output()" has been
        removed. Instead, please use the new mutable version of
        "DisplayConfiguration::for_each_output()" with which you can modify
        the output structure passed in on each iteration.
      . Exposed formerly private class "GLRenderer" and demonstrated how
        to override its behaviour in demo-shell. This area is under
        construction and may experience further major changes.
    - Added initial support for hardware (HWC) overlays to accelerate
      rendering and reduce power consumption. Not complete yet.
    - Screen rotation: Added mouse cursor rotation support, so you can now
      still control things on a rotated screen. Still missing rotation of
      the cursor bitmap itself.
    - Lots of fixes to support nested Mir servers (see below).
    - Major simplification to how surface size/position/transformation
      interact, making transformations much easier to manage and work with.
    - Bugs fixed:
      . ./cross-compile-chroot.sh: line 83: popd: build-android-arm: invalid
        argument popd: usage: popd [-n] [+N | -N] (LP: #1287600)
      . Key events sent to the wrong client (and delayed) (LP: #1213804)
      . Nested servers never receive input events (in their filters)
        (LP: #1260612)
      . Software clients crash immediately on nested servers - what(): Failed
        to mmap buffer (LP: #1261286)
      . MirMotionEvent lacks local coordinates. Reports only screen
        coordinates. (LP: #1268819)
      . Nested Mir crashes with - what():
        MesaNativePlatform::create_internal_client is not implemented yet!

      . clients fail to find some libraries if mir installed via "make install"
        (LP: #1285566)
      . Nested server hangs with multimonitor and internal clients.
        (LP: #1287282)
      . [regression] Multi-monitor frame sync no longer works (not
        synchronized), and frames skip/jump/stutter (LP: #1288570)
      . Mir FTBFS: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmirtestdraw (when cmake ..
        -DMIR_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF) (LP: #1283951)
      . nested Mir library calls next_buffer() during startup (LP: #1284739)

mir (0.1.5+14.04.20140212-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  [ Kevin Gunn ]
  * Cherry-picked from future release 0.1.6:
    - frontend, shell: provide the client process ID in the shell::Session
      interface (LP: #1276704)

mir (0.1.4+14.04.20140204-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * New upstream release 0.1.4 (https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.1.4)
    - Fixed snapshotting and flicker problems for Unity8 on various Nexus
      devices.
    - Enhanced reporting of performance information:
      . Report input latency in InputReport/InputReceiverReport.
      . Added a CompositorReport for logging compositor performance and state.
    - Added a new package "mir-utils" containing new tools:
      . mirping: Displays round-trip times between client and server
      . mirout: Displays the monitor layout/configuration details
    - Added GL texture caching to improve performance when multiple surfaces
      are visible.
    - Added opacity controls to mir_demo_server_shell
    - Mir server ABI bumped to 13. Client ABI bumped to 5.
    - Removed lots of Android headers, replaced by build-dep: android-headers
    - Added support for translucent nested servers.
    - tests: Fix unitialized values and incorrect fd closing loops
    - Fix unitialized values and incorrect fd closing loops.
    - client: Add basic MirScreencast C API.
    - config: start moving default values for config options from all the
      call sites to the setup
    - tests: Provide a helper for running clients with a stub ClientPlatform.
    - android: split out HWC layers into their own file and add a
      mga::CompositionLayer type that depends on the interface mg::Renderable.
    - client: Add basic MirOutputCapture class.
    - client: Don't create mesa ClientBuffer objects from invalid
      MirBufferPackages.
    - Optimize surface resizing to avoid doing anything if the dimensions
      are unchanged.
    - SwitchingBundle - add operator<< for debugging.
    - support hwcomposer 1.2 for android 4.4 on nexus 4 (which needs hwc1.2
      support). This patch adds hwc1.2 device construction, as well as progs
      the 'skip' layer in HWC to the buffer properties of the framebuffer.
    - demo-shell: Add simple keyboard controls to rotate outputs; Ctrl +
      Alt + <arrow-key>. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1203215.
    - frontend: exposing internals of the RPC mechanism to enable custom
      function calls to be added.
    - Make udev wrapper into a top-level citizen
    - compositor: ignore double requests to start or stop the
      MultiThreadedCompositor.
    - Add DisplayBuffer::orientation(), to tell the Renderer if we need it
      to do screen rotation in GL (for platforms which don't implement 
      rotation natively) Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1203215.
    - graphics: add an post_update function that takes a list of renderables
      to the display buffer. This will let the display buffer take advantage
      of full-surface overlays on android.
    - android-input: Improve debug output
    - the stock qcom 8960 hwcomposer chokes on getDisplayAttributes if the
      submitted arrays are not at least size 6. patched the qcom android 4.2
      hwcomposer driver on the ubuntu touch images to work properly, but
      causes us problems with in-the wild drivers, and the new 4.4 drivers.
      Make sure we always submit a larger-than-needed array to this function.
    - frontend: refactoring to make it easier to expose the underlying RPC
      transport on the server side.
    - Don't assume pressure value is zero if not yet known
    - build: Expose options to allow building but not running tests by default.
    - Translucent Server which prefers a transparent pixel format
    - frontend: refactor ProtobufMessageProcessor to separate out generic
      response sending logic from specific message handling.
    - client: expose the part of the client RPC infrastructure needed for
      downstream to prototype their own message sending.
    - Bugs fixed:
      . unity8 display flickers and stops responding on Nexus 7 (grouper)
        (LP: #1238695)
      . Mir gets textures/buffers confused when running both scroll and flicker
        demos (LP: #1263592)
      . Some snapshots on Nexus10 upside-down (LP: #1263741)
      . mir_unit_tests is crashing with SIGSEGV in libhybris gl functions
        (LP: #1264968)
      . Some snapshots on Nexus10 have swapped red/blue channels (LP: #1265787)
      . Bypass causes some non-bypassed surfaces (on top) to be invisible
        (LP: #1266385)
      . helgrind: Possible data race - MirConnection::mutex not used
        consistently (LP: #1243575)
      . helgrind: Lock order violated (potential deadlock) in
        ConnectionSurfaceMap (LP: #1243576)
      . helgrind: Possible data race - inconsistent locking in PendingCallCache
        (LP: #1243578)
      . helgrind: Lock order violated in
        mir::client::ConnectionSurfaceMap::erase(int) (LP: #1243584)
      . [enhancement] Allow a Mir nested server to have a transparent
        background (LP: #1256702)
      . Compiling without tests fails (-DMIR_ENABLE_TESTS=NO) (LP: #1263724)
      . examples, doc: Make it clear and consistent how to use
        a non-root client with a root compositor endpoint. 
        (LP: #1272143)
      . Avoid linking to umockdev on platforms (android) which don't yet
        use it. This allows mir_unit_tests to run on touch images again
        (LP: #1271434)
      . Workaround for N4 nested server issue. This change removes
        mir_pixel_format_bgr_888 - HAL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB_888 from the
        list of supported pixel formats on android. (LP: #1272041)
      . Don't ask glUniformMatrix4fv to transpose your matrix. That option
        was officially deprecated between OpenGL and OpenGL|ES. And some
        drivers like the Nexus 10 don't implement it, resulting in incorrect
        transformations and even nothing on screen! (LP: #1271853)
      . Fixes: bug 1272143 (LP: #1272143)
      . fix integration test failure on the galaxy nexus that was due to
        creating two surfaces and registering the same buffer twice. Fixes:
        (LP: #1272597)
      . Implement screen rotation in GLRenderer, for platforms
        which can't do it natively in DisplayBuffer.
        (LP: #1203215)
      . Add an "orientation" field to output structures in preparation for
        screen rotation. It's not yet functionally wired to anything.
        (LP: #1203215)
      . Only use SwitchingBundle::last_consumed after it has been
        set. Otherwise SwitchingBundle::compositor_acquire could follow a bogus
        code path. (LP:#1270964)
      . tests: Override configuration to avoid creating an (unused)
        filesystem endpoint for connections when using InProcessServer. 
        (LP: #1271604)
      . frontend: ensure that BasicConnector threads don't exit
        immediately. (LP: #1271655)

  [ Kevin Gunn ]
  * New upstream release 0.1.2
    - graphics: android: improve interface for mga::DisplayDevice so its
      just concerned with rendering and posting.
    - surfaces: rename "surfaces" component to "scene".
    - surfaces, shell: Migrate Session data model from shell to surfaces.
    - graphics: change fill_ipc_package() to use real pointers.
    - mir_client_library.h: Fix typo "do and locking" should be "do any
      locking".
    - API enumerations cleanup: Remove slightly misleading *_enum_max_
      values, and replace them with more accurate plural forms.
    - test_android_communication_package: Do not expect opened fd to be >0,
      we may have closed stdin making this a valid value (LP: #1247718).
    - Update docs about running Mir on the desktop to mention new package
      ubuntu-desktop-mir.
    - offscreen: Add a display that renders its output to offscreen buffers
    - graphics: android: fix regression for hwc1.0 devices introduced in r1228
      (LP: #1252433).
    - OffscreenPlatform provides the services that the offscreen display
      needs from the Platform.
    - graphics: android: consolidate the GLContexts classes in use.
    - Fix uninitialized variable causing random drm_auth_magic test
      failures. (LP: #1252144).
    - Add a fullyish functional Udev wrapper. This currently sits in
      graphics/gbm, but will be moved to the top-level when input device
      detection migrates.
    - Add resizing support to example code; demo-shell and clients.
    - eglapp: Clarify messages about pixel formats (LP: #1168304).
    - Adds support to the MirMotionEvent under pointer_coordinates called
      tool_type. This will allow clients to tell what type of tool is
      being used, from mouse/finger/etc. (LP: #1252498)
    - client,frontend: Report the real available surface pixel formats to
      clients. (LP: #1240833)
    - graphics: android: 1) change hwc1.1 to make use of sync fences during
      the compositor's gl renderloop. Note that we no longer wait for the
      render to complete, we pass this responsibility to the driver and the
      kernel. 2) support nexus 10. (LP: #1252173) (LP: #1203268)
    - shell: don't publish SurfacesContainer - it can be private to shell.
    - gbm: Don't mess up the VT mode on setup failure Only restore the
      previous VT mode during shutdown if it was VT_AUTO.
    - Fix a crash due to a failed eglMakeCurrent() call when in nested mode.
    - shell: unity-mir uses shell::FocusSetter - make the header public again
    - Add resize support to client surfaces (mir::client::MirSurface).
    - graphics: android: support 'old aka 2012' nexus 7 hwc (nvidia tegra3
      SoC) better. (LP: #1231917)
    - Add resize support to *ClientBuffer classes. Now always get dimensions
      from the latest buffer package.
    - android: support driver hooks for the Mali T604 (present in nexus 10)
    - Add width and height to the protocol Buffer messages, in preparation
      for resizable surfaces.
    - surfaces, shell, logging, tests: don't publish headers
      that can be private to surfaces. surfaces/basic_surface.h,
      surfaces/surface_controller.h and shell/surface_builder.h
    - examples: Restore GL framebuffer binding when destroying the render
      target
    - examples, surfaces, shell: remove render_surfaces dependency on
      BasicSurface
    - geometry: remove implementation of streaming operators from headers
      (LP: #1247820)
    - Eliminate the registration order focus sequence, folding it's
      functionality in to the session container.
    - Ensure the session mediator releases acquired buffer resources before
      attempting to acquire a new buffer on behalf of the client. This fixes
      performance regression (LP: #1249210).
    - Some cleanups to test_client_input.cpp.
    - Factor out a bunch of "ClientConfigCommon".
    - Small cleanup to session container test to increase encapsulation.
    - shell, surfaces: Another step in "fixing" the surfaces hierarchies -
      only publish interfaces and putting the data model into surfaces.
    - graphics: android: HWC1.1 use EGL to get further information about
      the framebuffer pixel format.
    - Fix FTBS using use_debflags=ON (building for android-armhf).
      (LP: #1248014)
    - Add a client input receiver report.
    - doc: doxygen 1.8.4 complains about an obsolete config so ran "doxygen
      u Doxyfile.in".
    - Implement resize() for the server-side Surface classes.
    - android: clean up mga::DisplayBuffer and mga::DisplayBufferFactory
    - Add resize() support to BufferStream, in preparation for resizable
      surfaces.
    - Merge metadata changes from the newly reconstructed lp:mir
    - tests: Deduplicate mg::GraphicBufferAllocator stubs.
    - examples: Remove spurious use of mir/shell/surface.h.
    - frontend: remove ClientTrackingSurface from the Surface class
      hierarchy
    - Bumping ABI on server to libmirserver11.
    - Don't mention "Renderable". That interface hasn't existed for quite
      some time now.
    - android-input: Assign more unique touch ids

    - Update docs and scripting for trusty.
    - compositor: Make DefaultDisplayBufferCompositorFactory private to the

    - Ignore warnings clang treats as errors, about unused functions being
      generated from macros in <lttng/tracepoint.h> (LP: #1246590)
    - Add resize() support to BufferBundle. This is the first step and lowest

    valid cases when the server blocks for an indeterminate amount of
    time during a client request, like when a next_buffer request blocks
    because a surface is not visible or the server is paused. In such
    cases, the timeout mechanism we used to detect server crashes caused
    the clients to fail. Furthermore, the clients seem able to detect
    server crashes without the timeout, rendering it needless anyway.

    On some systems this can have a noticeable performance benefit.

  * server: Extend server status (formerly pause/resume) listener to

    libmirserver, so they can properly synchronize external interactions
    with the server. (LP: #1239876)
  * graphics,examples: Don't enable more outputs than supported when
    changing the display configuration. (LP: #1217877)
  * client: Allow clients to call API functions after a connection break
    has been detected When a client tries to call an API function after
    a connection break has been detected in a previous API call, the
    client blocks in the new call. This happens because in
    MirSocketRpcChannel::notify_disconnected() the pending RPC calls are
    not forced to complete, since the channel has already been marked as
    'disconnected' by the failure in the previous call. Note that if the
    break is first detected while calling an API function, then that
    call doesn't block, since this is the first time we call
    MirSocketRpcChannel::notify_disconnected() and the pending RPC calls
    are forced to complete. This commit solves this problem by always
    forcing requests to complete when a communication failure occurs,
    even if a disconnection has already been handled. This is preferred
    over the alternative of manually calling the completion callback in
    a try-catch block when calling an RPC method because of: 1.
    Correctness: In case the communication problem first occurs in that
    call, the callback will be called twice, once by
    notify_disconnected() and once manually. 2. Consistency: The
    callback is called from one place regardless of whether the
    communication problem is first detected during that call or not.

  * SwitchingBundle: Simplify and clarify guarantees that
    compositor_acquire always has a buffer to return without blocking or
    throwing an exception. The trade-off is that to enforce the
    guarantee we need to permanently reserve one buffer for compositing.
    This reduces the flexibility of SwitchingBundle a little, such that
    minimum nbuffers is now 2. This was originally requested by
    Alexandros, as the potential throw concerned him. Although, it was
    logically guaranteed to never happen for other reasons. The second
    reason for doing this is to eliminate recycling logic, which while
    safe and correct, was quite confusing. So this change further proves
    that that logic (now removed) is not to blame for frame ordering
    bugs. .

  * Fix server-side tracking of client buffers When the server knows the
    client has a given buffer cached it only needs to send the BufferID
    rather than the full IPC package. While this is an optimisation,
    it's also required for correctness - the client will not clean up
    fds for buffers it has cached, so if the server sends a full IPC
    package for a buffer the client knows about any buffer fds leak. The
    buffer cache is per-surface on the client side, but was per-session
    on the server side. This meant that the server did not accurately
    track the client's buffers, resulting in it sending unexpected fds
    that the client then leaked. Fix this by making the buffer tracker
    per-surface server-side.

  * shell: Add infrastructure for emitting and handling session related
    events.
  * shell: Support per-session display configurations This MP adds
    support for per-session display configurations, i.e., configurations
    that are active only when the client that submitted them has the
    focus. mir_connection_apply_display_config() now changes the session
    display configuration instead of the base/global one.

mir (0.0.8+13.10.20130809.3-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * Simplify and generalize buffer swapping to support arbitrary numbers
    of: - buffers - compositors - clients This is a unified N-buffers
    algorithm which supports any positive number of buffers, as well as
    dynamically switching between synchronous and asynchronous
    behaviour. So it does everything the existing code does and more.
    The key requirement is to support an arbitrary number of (different)
    simultaneous compositor acquisitions, as is needed for bypass
    support (coming soon). This then leads to the requirement that a
    compositor and a snapshot buffer should be acquired differently.
    Because a snapshot should never consume frames, only observe them.
    On the other hand, a compositior acquire must consume a frame (if
    available) so as to guarantee correct ordering when more than one
    are acquired simultaneously in bypass mode. Also fixes LP: #1199717
    and is half the fix for LP: #1199450. (LP: #1199450, #1199717)

  * Fix clearly-broken code, for which clang produced deliberately
    broken output.
  * Fix two issues caught by Clang's static analyser.
  * I like clang's error messages. Let's keep Mir building on clang.
  * Make libmirclient not aggressively signal-unsafe by blocking signals
    on our IO thread. Fixes infinite loop in XMir (LP: #1199319). (LP:
    #1199319)
  * Document XMir drivers too.

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * Small copyright fixes (lp: #1195647). (LP: #1195647)

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * Cache the transformation matrix; only recalculate it when some part
    of the transformation changes. (LP: #1193020) . (LP: #1193020)
  * Don't pass a clang-only option to gcc. It will not understand and
    cause build failure (LP: #1194385). (LP: #1194385)
  * Fix build failure due to differing exception specifiers. noexcept
    destructors should be enforced in derived classes if the base uses
    them. (LP: #1194703). (LP: #1194703)
  * Document thread safety pitfalls about client-side callbacks. .
  * Fix mismatched destructor exception specifiers causing build failure
    in gcc 4.7. Also fix struct/class mismatches that some compilers
    will treat as an error. (LP: #1196415). (LP: #1196415)
  * mir_demo_client_unaccelerated: Add an FPS count, and a "-n" option
    to disable vsync (set swap interval to 0).
  * mir_demo_client_egl*: Add a "-n" option to disable syncing to vblank
    (hence to use swap interval == 0).
  * Initial attempts at making the Mir client API thread safe.
    Ordinarily you would not build locking into an API, however the fact
    that Mir clients implicitly get multiple threads created for them
    makes it important for the API itself to be automatically thread
    safe. I've tried to avoid API changes, but adding a new function:
    mir_wait_for_one was necessary. This is because mir_wait_for doesn't
    work if multiple threads are waiting on the same thing
    simultaneously. And the fact that waiting at all is optional means
    we can't change the behaviour of mir_wait_for -- it must always wait
    for all outstanding results (which is only safe in clients where the
    waiting happens in a single thread). .
  * Work around GCC issue 50043 which is causing build failures on
    raring. (LP: #1199210) The gcc bug is only fixed in 4.8/saucy. (LP:
    #1199210)
  * MockDisplayConfigurationPolicy: Work around gcc-4.7 bugs causing
    build failure on raring. (LP: #1200064). (LP: #1200064)
  * Another workaround for gcc-4.7 bugs causing build failure. (LP:
    #1200107). (LP: #1200107)
  * buffer_swapper_spin.h: Remove dead code: initialize_queues.
  * Remove unused interface surfaces::GraphicRegion It became unused
    when Kevin's work landed in r856 yesterday. .
  * Rename compositor::Renderables --> compositor::Scene What is a
    "Renderables"? It's the interface by which we know the scene graph,
    or the model of how all the surfaces relate to each other. Right,
    then call it a scene graph... but the word "graph" might imply a
    particular structure. And we don't want to imply such things in an
    interface. So just call it "scene". That makes slightly more sense
    than imagining what a "Renderables" (singular) is.
  * Fix comments which mention incorrect namespaces for Buffer following
    yesterday's landings.

  [ Ricardo Mendoza ]
  * Fix broken tests/unit-
    tests/client/android/test_client_android_registrar.cpp due to unused
    return value.

  [ Thomas Voß ]
  * Wait for vt to become active if we need to activate it.
  * Remove disabling asio's epoll reactor implementation from the
    package build flags.
  * Introduce cmake options to be able to selectively switch acceptance,
    integration and unit tests on/off. (LP: #1195265)

  [ Thomi Richards ]
  * Remove workaround for bug #1198022. (LP: #1198022)

  [ Robert Carr ]
  * Add raise method to surface stack.
  * Remove cucumber and all references. (LP: #1194075)
  * Add support for shaped input regions.
  * Store MirMotionAction as integer due to usage of extra bits by
    android input stack. (LP: #1197108)
  * Fix obscurance of touch events according to stacking.
  * Extract DefaultServerConfiguration::the_cursor_listener from
    DefaultServerConfiguration::the_input_configuration. (LP: #1192916)
  * Implement a connection authorization mechanism.
  * Correct test_surface_stack.cpp ordering tests.
  * Move the DepthId in surface creation to
    msh::SurfaceCreationParameters.
