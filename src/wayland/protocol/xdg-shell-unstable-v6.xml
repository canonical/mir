    <description summary="child surface positioner">
      The xdg_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a
      child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure
      the child surface remains within the visible area's borders, and to
      specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along
      an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are
      constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or
      be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

      See the various requests for details about possible rules.

      At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules
      specified by the xdg_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the
      xdg_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the
      object will have no effect on previous usages.

      For an xdg_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a
      non-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by
      set_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete xdg_positioner object when
      positioning a surface raises an error.

    <description summary="desktop user interface surface base interface">
      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

      It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
      interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
      toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
      xdg_surface roles.

      Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
      to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
      using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
      xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
      not based on xdg_surface.

      A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
      xdg_surface object.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_surface state to take effect.

      Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
      committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
      manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
      also be treated as errors.

      For a surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following conditions
      must be met: (1) the client has assigned a xdg_surface based role to the
      surface, (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and
      the role dependent state to the surface and (3) the client has committed a

  <interface name="zxdg_popup_v6" version="1">
    <description summary="short-lived, popup surfaces for menus">
      A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface. It can be used to
      implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user
      interface concepts.

      A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for
      details.

      When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
      the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done
      event for details.

      Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and
      unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
      surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
      request.

      The parent surface must have either the xdg_toplevel or xdg_popup surface
      role.

      A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
      xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.

      The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
      description) before the xdg_popup itself.

      The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
      where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the
      local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
      xdg_surface.get_popup. An xdg_popup must intersect with or be at least
      partially adjacent to its parent surface.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_popup state to take effect.

    <request name="grab">
      <description summary="make the popup take an explicit grab">
	This request makes the created popup take an explicit grab. An explicit
	grab will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup, or when the
	client destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user clicking
	outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen
	through closing the lid or a timeout.

	If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately
	dismissed.

	This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a
	button press, key press, or touch down event. The serial number of the
	event should be passed as 'serial'.

	The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or
	another xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another
	xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being
	the topmost popup.

	Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
	in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the
	topmost one.

	When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every
	nested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it
	will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

	The parent of a grabbing popup must either be another xdg_popup with an
	active explicit grab, or an xdg_popup or xdg_toplevel, if there are no
	explicit grabs already taken.

	If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to
	the parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.

	If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this
	popup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did
	not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

	During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer
	and touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an
	"target-events" grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
	will always have keyboard focus.
