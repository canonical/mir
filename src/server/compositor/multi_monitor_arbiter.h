/**
 * Coordinate surface buffer consumption across different outputs
 *
 * When multiple compositors have a view on the same surface, they will
 * request buffers from that surface at their own pace, gated by either
 * the display VSync (for compositors driving physical outputs), by
 * client consumption (for compositors for screencopy), or some other
 * mechanism.
 *
 * These timings will (almost always) not align, so if each compositor's
 * request advanced the surface buffer we would request frames at some
 * multiple of the frequencies involved.
 *
 * As an additional constraint, it must always be possible for a compositor
 * to acquire a buffer.
 *
 * To avoid this, the MultiMonitorArbiter stores up to two buffers -
 * a current buffer and a next buffer - and tracks which compositor has
 * seen the current buffer. The next buffer is only advanced when a
 * compositor requests a buffer *and* that compositor has seen the current buffer.
 *
 * This results in the buffer queue being advanced at only the rate of the fastest
 * compositor.
 *
 * Unfortunately, because this doesn't have any feedback into any other
 * component, we can get into a state where there *is* a new buffer available
 * for a surface, but the *Compositor* isn't going to request a buffer until
 * something else changes. This is most easy to trigger around mode switches,
 * where we destroy all Compositors and then create new ones which then,
 * definitionally, haven't seen the current buffer.
 *
 * This system will need to be significantly overhauled in future. A variety
 * of Wayland extensions we wish to support - notably wp_presentation and
 * wp_fifo - expect that a surface's buffer queue is synchronised to a single
 * output.
