    Creates Mir input events out of Qt input events
    
    The class is splitt into miroil::EventBuilder which does the internal mir stuff, 
    and qtmir::EventBuilder which handles the qt stuff. 

    One important feature is that it's able to match a QInputEvent with the MirInputEvent that originated it, so
    it can make a MirInputEvent version of a QInputEvent containing also information that the latter does not carry,
    such as relative axis movement for pointer devices.

      its original MirInputEvent so that it can be consumed by a mir::scene::Surface and properly handled by mir clients
      we have to reach out to this EventRegistry to get the missing bits.

      Given the objective of this EventRegistry (MirInputEvent reconstruction after having gone through QQuickWindow input dispatch
      as a QInputEvent), it stores information only about the most recent MirInputEvents.
