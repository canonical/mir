/**
 * A thread-synchronisation barrier.
 *
 * The expected usage is that one thread sits in `wait()` until
 * signalled from another thread with `raise()`.
 *
 * This mechanism does not attempt to ensure that only one thread
 * is released per `raise()` or that each `raise()` unblocks only
 * one `wait()`. The only guarantees are that:
 * 1) At least one call to `raise()` strongly-happens-before 
 *    a call to `wait()` returns, and
 * 2) `wait()` will block until a call to `raise()` that 
 *    happens-after the most recent return from `wait()`.
 *
 * The primary use-case for such a barrier is to signal a
 * worker thread to run the next iteration of work.
 *
 * This is very similar to a `std::binary_semaphore` but
 * without the precondition that `raise()` is not called
 * if the Signal is already raised.
