    <description summary="child surface positioner">
      The mir_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a
      child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure
      the child surface remains within the visible area's borders, and to
      specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along
      an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are
      constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or
      be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

      See the various requests for details about possible rules.

      At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules
      specified by the mir_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the
      mir_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the
      object will have no effect on previous usages.

      For an mir_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a
      non-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by
      set_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete mir_positioner object when
      positioning a surface raises an invalid_positioner error.
