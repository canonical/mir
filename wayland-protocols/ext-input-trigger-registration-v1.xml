  <description summary="Registration of global input triggers and associated actions">
    This protocol allows for a privileged Wayland client to register ownership
    of input trigger events and associate them with actions.

    ext_input_trigger_registration_v1 and the associated ext_input_trigger_action_v1
    are based on the following discussion document:

      RFC

      We want to be able to extend this to other input types: mouse, touchpad,
      touchscreen, tablet pen, ...

      Either we guess a generic way to describe all these triggers (e.g. a string
      prefix),  or we plan to add specific registration requests later. The latter
      seems the better approach both.

      I envisage a family of requests:
        o register_keyboard_trigger
        o register_mouse_trigger
        o register_touchpad_trigger
        ...

          RFC

          Should we say "The keycombo must follow the XDG Shortcut standard"

          This is the wording from "action binder", but I have concerns.

          https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shortcuts-spec/latest/
          describes using the `XKB_MOD_NAME_...` symbols. But these are
          deprecated (and were deprecated before it was written).

           And "LOGO"? I think "Meta" is more widely known.
        -->
        The keycombo must follow the XDG Shortcut standard.

        The compositor will send either the ext_input_trigger_v1.done or
        ext_input_trigger_v1.failed event on the created object in
        response to this request.

        Input triggers registered by this request will result in an
        ext_input_trigger_action_v1.begin event when the key combination is
        depressed and ext_input_trigger_action_v1.end when the key combination
        changes.
