  <interface name="zwp_input_method_context_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="input method context">
      Corresponds to a text input on the input method side. An input method context
      is created on text input activation on the input method side. It allows
      receiving information about the text input from the application via events.
      Input method contexts do not keep state after deactivation and should be
      destroyed after deactivation is handled.

      Text is generally UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes.

      Serials are used to synchronize the state between the text input and
      an input method. New serials are sent by the text input in the
      commit_state request and are used by the input method to indicate
      the known text input state in events like preedit_string, commit_string,
      and keysym. The text input can then ignore events from the input method
      which are based on an outdated state (for example after a reset).

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        empty text when some text should be removed (see
        delete_surrounding_text) or when the input cursor should be moved (see
